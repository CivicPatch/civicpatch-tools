## Mayor’s Biography

Term: 2024 - 2027

Redmond Mayor Angela Birney is well-versed in managing growth. As a former middle school science teacher, she has helped expand young students' minds through education. Now in her second term as Mayor, she is leading the progress of a community of more than 80,000 people as it evolves from a suburb to a city. 

Redmond is known for its diverse industries, including aerospace, high tech, video game production, biotech, and thousands of small businesses employing nearly 100,000 people. Since taking office, Mayor Birney has helped accelerate the City’s development to new heights. 

As a member of multiple boards regionally, statewide, and nationally, the Mayor has created a thriving network of partners with whom she has successfully collaborated on projects and funding, resulting in major advances and greater visibility for the City.  

From light rail stations to housing for all income levels to business development to sustainability and the environment, Mayor Birney’s vision to create a vibrant, complete, green city where people can access most of what they need in their daily lives within a few blocks and without a car, is quickly becoming a reality.     

And more is coming in the form of new light rail stations, additional housing, increased economic develop from global events like World Cup 2026, and the launch of the Redmond 2050 Comprehensive Plan, the largest community engagement effort ever conducted in Redmond. The strategy is in place to grow the City in a way that will benefit future generations - including the middle school science students the Mayor once taught.
