Their terms are effective from January 2024 through December 2027.

Kritzer has been honored to serve on the City Council for the last four years and is looking forward to continuing to provide community-centered leadership in a second term. She has devoted her career to working for social and environmental justice. Kritzer has experience in the nonprofit, government, and private sectors. In addition to her council work, she is currently the Executive Director of the Washington Association of Land Trusts, where she works to protect Washington’s lands, waterways, and wildlife for future generations. Kritzer attended undergrad at Vassar College, earning a Bachelor of Arts in Latin American and Latinx studies and political science, and obtained a Master of Business Administration from the University of Washington Foster School of Business and a Master of Public Administration from the UW Evans School of Public Policy and Governance. Before joining Council, Kritzer served on the City of Redmond’s Planning Commission. She lives in Education Hill with husband and two young kids.
