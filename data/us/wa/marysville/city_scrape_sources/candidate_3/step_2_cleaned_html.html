We are proactively and aggressively combatting the drug epidemic with a mix of offering services to those who want help and law enforcement actions for criminal behaviors. We are making good progress in filling several newly budgeted police officer positions and are working with other city officials to seek stronger state laws that equip our police officers to better fight crime. </li>
<li><p>Committed to careful <strong>financial stewardship</strong> with the full transparency and accountability that our residents deserve. We maintain a balanced budget and have obtained millions in grant dollars to stretch our local tax dollars further. We strive to keep local taxes low.</p></li>
<li>Continue to make local investments and work with state and federal elected officials to obtain funding for <strong>major transportation projects to</strong> <strong>i</strong><strong>mprove traffic circulation and alleviate traffic congestion</strong>. <ul>
<li>Complete the widening of State Avenue from three lanes to five when the final section between 104th to 116th is finished in fall 2024. </li>
<li id="isPasted">WSDOT will open a new I-5 HOV lane between north Everett and south Marysville in late 2024. </li>
<li>The city completed the First Street Bypass in 2020 in anticipation of the state's full new freeway interchange including on- and off-ramps connecting SR 529 to I-5 scheduled for completion in late 2025.</li>
<li>Other projects fully funded and scheduled for construction include: <ul>
<li>a new I-5 interchange at 156th<sup> </sup>Street NE (scheduled completion by 2031), and</li>
<li>Community Transit SWIFT Line, bringing bus rapid transit to Marysville (scheduled completion 2027).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Developing parks</strong>, like the new Olympic View Park that opened in 2021; and a turf upgrade at Strawberry Fields Athletic Complex, a new Pump Track at Jennings Nature Park, and improvements to Comeford Park, all in 2023. <strong>Building more trails </strong>for our parks inventory, such as the Centennial Trail Connector that links the city’s Bayview Trail to the regional Centennial Trail. Other projects planned for the near future include:<ul>
<li>Ebey Waterfront Trail expansions including new trail sections along the newly constructed dike, completing the trail along Sunnyside Boulevard to connect with the First Street Bypass, and a new parking lot and trailhead by late 2025. </li>
<li>Bayview Trail extension to the south to meet planned trails in Lake Stevens and expand regional accessibility to our trail networks.   </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Expanding <strong>economic development</strong> efforts to provide more services for our residents as well as adding more family-wage jobs in Marysville with a specific focus on developing the master-planned Cascade Industrial Center in the Smokey Point area. </li>
<li>
<strong>Investing in our water infrastructure</strong> so that Marysville can be as self-sufficient as possible in providing water to residents and businesses. This will provide for stable rates far into the future and allow us to avoid paying the much higher rates that other cities face when purchasing water from other jurisdictions. We are making significant progress here and now provide the majority of our own water locally, decreasing the need to purchase expensive water from other entities.</li>
<li>
<strong>Maintaining customer service, transparency and accountability</strong> in city government and prioritizing constituent issues with prompt response. One example of this transparency is the Open Checkbook feature on the city website that gives taxpayers a clear, accessible way to review city finances.</li>
<li>Partnering with our residents and businesses to <strong>clean up Marysville</strong> and show real pride in our community, an effort that greatly benefits all of us.<strong> </strong>An example of this is our refocused effort on the litter control in the city. This is an ongoing, collaborative effort with a combination of city staff and volunteers working in the community.</li>
