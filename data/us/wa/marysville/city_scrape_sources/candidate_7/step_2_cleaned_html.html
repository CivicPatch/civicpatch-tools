<p>As Mayor of the City of Marysville, I am pleased to welcome you to our city. Thank you for visiting us and taking the time to learn more about our community. From our quaint old downtown neighborhoods to our eastside homes with panoramic views of Puget Sound, our wide variety of shops, our schools and parks, and our community services and inherent volunteerism, Marysville has something for everyone to discover and enjoy. </p>
<p>Marysville is a wonderful place to visit, live, play or work. It is Snohomish County's second-largest city with a population of more than 70,000. Marysville's vibrant charm is exceeded only by the remarkable people who call it home. While times have changed, the friendliness and hospitality that recall a simpler time remain the heart of our community.</p>
<p id="isPasted">Here in Marysville, we have seen many new commercial entities open their doors throughout the past several years to serve the needs of our community. In actively partnering with The Greater Marysville Tulalip Chamber of Commerce, Economic Alliance Snohomish County and others, we will continue to seek to meet the ongoing and changing needs of those who call Marysville home. Along with many added businesses and retailers over the past few years, Marysville has also recently drawn a lot of interest from auto dealerships in the Smokey Point area; these include Rairdon’s Honda of Marysville, Kendall Ford of Marysville, Marysville Toyota, Marysville Auto Center and Roy Robinson RV Center.</p>
<p>In Marysville, we prioritize responsible and efficient use of taxpayer dollars. We have not increased the amount of the city’s portion of the property tax in over 10 years. Additionally, we have 15 years of clean financial audits.</p>
<p id="isPasted">As a full-service city responsive to its citizens, Marysville takes care of its needs for today while building a better tomorrow, and is well-prepared for the changes ahead that affect our citizens and the region. Among other things, the city offers its residents and businesses:</p>
<ul type="disc">
<li>Extensive and expanding public safety services, emphasis and prioritization</li>
<li>a city-run jail</li>
<li>water and sewer availability at competitive rates</li>
<li>city-operated garbage pickup</li>
<li>an expansive library</li>
<li>numerous recreational programs</li>
<li>acres of lush, green parks to enjoy</li>
<li>increased inventory of beautiful new trails to explore</li>
<li>new cultural offerings at the Opera House.</li>
</ul>
<p>I invite you to explore our website - and our city - to discover all that our area has to offer. Experience Marysville: Live, Work, Play.</p>
