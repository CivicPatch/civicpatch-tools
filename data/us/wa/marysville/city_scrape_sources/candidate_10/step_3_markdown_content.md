### You're invited: Mayor’s State of the City address Jan. 28

  ![Mayor Jon Nehring](images/06d65aae005f8ff45e7afc1c5466ea4ff01ee105483454096ab394eb8f3d1c09)  

Mayor Jon Nehring invites you to join him for his State of the City presentation on Tuesday, Jan. 28. He will describe the City of Marysville’s major accomplishments in 2024 and offer a preview of what's ahead in 2025 and beyond. The free program will wrap up with the opportunity for the public to ask questions. 

 * Tuesday, Jan. 28
 * Doors open at 6 p.m.; program starts at 6:30
 * Marysville Civic Center, 501 Delta Ave. (2nd Floor, Council Chambers) and livestream on city Facebook page @MarysvilleWashington

“Marysville is in a solid position to continue serving our residents well with the city services they expect and deserve,” Mayor Nehring said. “I appreciate the shared fiscal values and positive working relationship with our City Council that allow the City of Marysville to continue making progress on long-term priority programs without facing drastic budget cuts or raising taxes.” 

The recorded presentation will be available in February on the city website ( [www.marysvillewa.gov](https://www.marysvillewa.gov) ) and on Marysville public access TV channels, Comcast channel 21 and Ziply channel 25.
