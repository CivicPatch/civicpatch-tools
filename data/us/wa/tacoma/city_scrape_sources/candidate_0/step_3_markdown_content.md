# Neighborhood Council Program

   

 Neighborhood Council Program Overview 

There are eight Neighborhood Councils and one overarching Community Council that support Tacoma’s diverse communities by engaging with City staff on neighborhood issues, concerns, and priorities identified by community members. The Neighborhood Council Program aims to create an environment in which community members have an opportunity to:

 * Meaningfully discuss City programs and policies that affect their neighborhoods.
 * Bring neighborhood concerns, priorities, and goals to the attention of the city.
 * Encourage diverse relationships and representative participation where residents feel they positively impact and improve the livability of their communities.

Each Neighborhood Council serves as an independent, non-profit organization to promote community-based efforts for neighborhood improvement. The program is committed to racial equity in all operations and is focused on increasing board representation of underrepresented communities. Any resident, business owner, employee, property owner or member of an existing neighborhood group within a Neighborhood Council area can join a Neighborhood Council.
