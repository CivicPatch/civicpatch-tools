## Transportation Benefit District

### What is a TBD?

TBD stands for Transportation Benefit District. A TBD is a quasi-municipal entity created for the sole purpose of acquiring, constructing, improving, providing and funding transportation improvements within the district. Under  [RCW 36.73](http://apps.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=36.73)  the Washington State Legislature permits local governments to establish a TBD and accompanying funding sources to provide for the preservation, maintenance and construction of local public ways.

### Vancouver Street Funding Strategy/TBD Accomplishments

Vancouver’s Transportation Benefit District is committed to transparency and accountability, providing community members with information and updates on what revenues it receives and where the funds are spent. Each year, Vancouver provides a report back to the community, which also includes overall Street Funding Strategy revenues, expenses and projects.

### About the Vancouver Transportation Benefit District (TBD)

The Vancouver Transportation Benefit District (TBD) is a quasi-municipal entity, a legally separate and distinct body from the City of Vancouver, formed to support transportation improvements.

The boundaries of the TBD are identical with the City limits. By law, it is therefore required to be governed by the members of that legislative body (Vancouver City Council). acting as a separate legal entity, The Mayor of the City of Vancouver serves as the TBD Chairperson, presiding over meetings. The Mayor Pro Tem of the City of Vancouver serves as the Vice Chairperson and presides over meetings in the absence of the TBD Chair. Vancouver’s City Manager is chief executive officer and oversees the administration of the TBD.

Regular Board meetings are scheduled by the Board through a resolution in the first quarter of each calendar year. Notice is given using procedures identical to those used for regular meetings of the Vancouver City Council, as consistent with state Open Public Meetings Act.

Under state law  [RCW 36.73](http://apps.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=36.73) , Vancouver’s TBD has the authority to impose and/or seek voter approval of certain taxes or fees, which in turn must be dedicated to improving transportation systems. Construction, maintenance, and operation costs are eligible.
