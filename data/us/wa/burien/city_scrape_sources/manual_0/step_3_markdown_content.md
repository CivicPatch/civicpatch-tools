## City Council Honors Outgoing Councilmembers, Welcomes New Councilmembers

The City Council presented proclamations and a key to the city to Mayor Sofia Aragon and Councilmember Cydney Moore.

Linda Akey, Alex Andrade, and Kevin Schilling, who won council positions in the recent election, took their oaths of office.

Both incoming and outgoing councilmembers were celebrated at a special reception prior to the regular meeting.

## Parks, Recreation and Open Space Plan Presented

City Council heard the first of a series of scheduled presentations on the updated [Parks, Recreation and Open Space (PROS) Plan](https://connect.burienwa.gov/projects/parks-recreation-and-open-space-plan-update). The City sought feedback on the elements of the plan through the [Shape Your City](https://connect.burienwa.gov/projects/shape-your-city) initiative.

The purpose of the PROS plan is to guide the future of Burien’s parks, recreation, and open space planning and capital project prioritization over the next six years. The plan includes an overview of community input, system analysis, themes and goals, and Capital Improvement Program (CIP) prioritization. It provides recommendations to support a wholistic system and provide opportunities for enhancements to the current system.

The planning process identified the following opportunities:

 * Parks and Recreation Centers are critical infrastructure for positive health outcomes.
 * Providing recreation and educational opportunities is a community-wide effort.
 * Integration of public art and representation bolster community ownership.

Challenges include:

 * Climate change leading to dire health and economic consequences.
 * Maintenance and funding limitations could impact system expansions.
 * The need for equitable access to safe parks and open spaces.

The plan proposes that capital improvement projects be prioritized using metrics that consider equity, existing conditions, level of service, and opportunities.

## City Council Discusses Revenue Options to Address Forecasted Revenue Gap

The City Council discussed options to raise revenues to address a forecasted revenue gap. They directed staff bring back legislation to review both council and voter-approved revenue options.

 * Deputy Mayor Schilling reported on his attendance of a Sound Cities Association meeting to approve funds to operate their organization.
