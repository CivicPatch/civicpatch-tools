This form allows you to send a message to the Mayor's Office regarding local matters. Due to the volume of messages we receive, we are not always able to respond to each email, but we do read every comment.

###  Judicial/Legal Issues 

As a local official, Mayor Brown cannot provide legal assistance or advice, nor does she have the authority to intervene in matters involving the judicial branch of government. The Mayor has no jurisdiction in most of these matters and cannot get involved because of the separation of powers.

###  County Issues 

As the elected official for the City of Spokane, Mayor Brown does not have any jurisdiction over agencies or issues outside of municipal boundaries.

To contact [Commissioner Al French](https://www.spokanecounty.org/2553/District-5---Al-French) or [Commissioner Amber Waldref](https://www.spokanecounty.org/5317/District-2---Amber-Waldref) or [Commissioner Chris Jordan](https://www.spokanecounty.org/5316/District-1--Chris-Jordan) or [Commissioner Josh Kerns](https://www.spokanecounty.org/2551/District-3---Josh-Kerns) or [Commissioner Mary Kuney](https://www.spokanecounty.org/2071/District-4---Mary-Kuney).
