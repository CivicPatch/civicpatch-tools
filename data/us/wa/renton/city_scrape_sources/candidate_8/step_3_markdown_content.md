 

# Council Committees

Many items brought before the entire council are referred to a [working committee for review](https://renton.civicweb.net/Portal/MeetingTypeList.aspx). Upon completion of that review, the committee makes a recommendation to the entire Council for a vote at a subsequent Council meeting. Committee reports are presented under "Unfinished Business" on the [agenda](https://renton.civicweb.net/filepro/documents/1097).

Upcoming council committee meetings are announced during council meetings and are available on the [city council calendar](https://www.rentonwa.gov/Government/City-Council/City-Council-Calendar).
