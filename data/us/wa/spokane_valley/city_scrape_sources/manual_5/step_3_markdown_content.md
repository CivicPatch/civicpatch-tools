# March 18, 2025

This week’s Spokane Valley City Council meeting began with the pledge of allegiance and approval of the following meeting agenda. __ __ 

###  __PROCLAMATIONS __ 

Mayor Haley presented a proclamation for [*National Vietnam Veterans Day*](https://spokanevalley.granicus.com/MetaViewer.php?view_id=3&event_id=1346&meta_id=96835) which was accepted by RaeAnna Victor of the Daughters of the American Revolution. [Watch the presentation](https://spokanevalley.granicus.com/player/clip/1514?meta_id=96908).  

###  __General Public Comments__ 

Each week, community members have an opportunity to address Councilmembers for up to three minutes during the General Public Comment period, either at the [beginning](https://spokanevalley.granicus.com/player/clip/1514?meta_id=96911) or [end](https://spokanevalley.granicus.com/player/clip/1514?meta_id=96946) of each meeting in person or via Zoom.  

##  __ACTION ITEMS__ 

###  __#1 Second Reading of Ordinance 25-001 Amending SVMC 22.110.020 Relating to Signs Within City Rights-of-Way__ 

The draft ordinance was presented for Council review and feedback on [Jan. 21](https://spokanevalley.granicus.com/player/clip/1491?meta_id=95481) and [Feb. 11, 2025](https://spokanevalley.granicus.com/player/clip/1495?meta_id=95963). A public hearing was held on [March 11, 2025](https://spokanevalley.granicus.com/player/clip/1512?meta_id=96704). The current code prohibits the placement of signs within the rights-of-way “except official signs and except bus benches”. As to non-commercial signs, the city’s practice has been to enforce this prohibition only when the sign creates an impediment to safe right-of-way use. The proposed code text amendments allow non-commercial signs to be placed along traveled portions of the right-of-way subject to time, place and manner restrictions to protect the safety of the traveling public. These amendments will bring the code in line with the city’s past practice and help ensure consistent content-neutral enforcement. The Council had a discussion about the topic, and the motion made to adopt Ord. 25-001, amending 22.110.020, was withdrawn to allow staff to work through more of the Council’s questions. It will come back at another meeting.

###  __#2 Interlocal Agreement (ILA) with Spokane Valley Fire Department (SVFD)__ 

An administrative report on this topic was presented on [Feb. 4, 2025](https://spokanevalley.granicus.com/player/clip/1494?meta_id=95789). The existing ILA became effective in 2006 and was amended in 2008 and 2012. This agreement specifies that SVFD provides services to the City of Spokane Valley, such as building/land use permit application reviews, new/existing building inspections, fire-safety permit applications, etc. New technology in electronic permit processing will allow SVFD to collect permit fee payments directly from the customers rather than through the City. The proposed ILA update preserves the same key services that have been in place since 2006, but updates wording to (1) clarify the fees for which each party is responsible for collecting, (2) clarify the process for collecting and distributing fees to each other as appropriate, and (3) minor edits to grammar, addresses, titles, etc. 

A motion to authorize the city manager to execute the amended ILA for fire services in the City of Spokane Valley passed unanimously.

###  __#5 Amended 2025 Federal Legislative Agenda __ 

The 2025 Federal Legislative Agenda was adopted on Oct. 22, 2024, and it was noted at the time that an update would be needed in the first quarter of 2025 due to the pending status of Fiscal Year (FY) 2025 Congressionally Directed Spending (CDS) requests and the city’s lodging tax allocation. The City received word that the 2025 CDS requests were not awarded by Congress and the proposed agenda includes updates to the Cross Course Fieldhouse funding section and CDS requests for the transportation projects, cosmetic map changes and amended capital project bullets to highlight the fieldhouse request. 

A motion to approve the 2025 Federal Legislative Agenda as amended passed unanimously.

###  __#7 Public Safety Sales Tax Discussion__ 

The City Council has discussed public safety funding numerous times over the past three years, most recently at the March 4, 2025, Winter Workshop pertaining to 2026 budget development. At the workshop, two crucial Public Safety costs were discussed: (1) cost increases for current service levels and (2) costs for hiring additional officers. Also, during the workshop, the Council discussed various options for new recurring revenue to address Public Safety costs. One option was a Public Safety Sales Tax, as authorized by RCW 82.14.450. This one-tenth of one percent (0.1%) sales tax must be approved by the voters. 

On March 18, legal counsel provided a background on the ballot proposition process, filing deadlines and potential effective dates of a sales tax increase if approved. Staff also reviewed the timeline for placing the measure on the Aug. 5, 2025, primary election ballot, should the Council decide to pursue a voter-approved Public Safety Tax measure. In addition to adopting an election ordinance, the Council must appoint both a pro and a con committee (made up of community members) responsible for preparing the pro/con statements in the voter’s pamphlet.  

Prior to increasing or imposing a new city tax, the Council must hold a public hearing. The Council reached a consensus to proceed with advertising for the public hearing on April 1, 2025.
