## City Council Elections

There are seven positions on the Spokane Valley City Council.  Council elections are held every two years and Councilmembers are elected to serve four-year terms. For continuity, Council position terms are staggered by two years so that all positions are not open for election at the same time. All Council positions are at-large positions.
