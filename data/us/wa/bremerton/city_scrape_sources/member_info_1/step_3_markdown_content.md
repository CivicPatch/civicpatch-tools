# Denise Frey

   [City Council](https://bremertonwa.gov/Directory.aspx?DID=38) 

Title: City Council District Number 2

Phone: [360-473-5280](tel:3604735280) 

Denise Frey represents Bremerton City Council District 2, which includes Bataan Park and Eastpark Nature Area (Madrona Trails), and areas along the Wheaton Way corridor bounded at the north by Riddell Road. 

Due to a vacancy left when the previous Council Member resigned, Denise was appointed by the City Council on March 23, 2022 to fill the position until the November 7, 2023 General Election Results were certified.  Denise was then elected, so she completed the end of that unexpired term to the end of 2023. Denise is now serving her first full term through 2027. 

In 2025, Denise serves on the Public Works Committee and Public Safety Committee.

Council Member Denise Frey is committed to smart and sustainable development along the Wheaton Way Corridor and within the Eastside Village (old Harrison Hospital area) Project. Bringing the East Bremerton community together to address issues specific to its health and well-being is her priority. Council Member Frey will balance the needs of East Bremerton residents, businesses and commuters while building collaborations between the public and private sectors to improve the quality of life for all Bremertonians.
