Eric Younger represents Bremerton City Council District 7 which includes Kitsap Lake Park, NAD Park, Pendergast Regional Park, a portion of Kitsap Way, and the area reaching south towards Gorst. Providing boundaries for the district are the Kitsap County neighborhoods called West Hills and Navy Yard City. 

Eric was appointed by the Council Members on May 2, 2001 to fill a seat vacated when the elected Council Member resigned; and then was elected in the fall of that year to fill the remainder of the term through 2003 (2- ½ years total). Following an 8-year gap, Eric was elected again in 2012 to a 2-year term when the City of Bremerton transitioned from a 9-Member, to a 7-Member City Council; and has since been elected three more times to serve 4-year terms beginning in 2014, 2018, and 2022.   Eric was Council President previously from 2016 – 2020. 

In 2025, Eric is Council President. He serves on the LEOFF 1 Police Pension Board, Kitsap 911 Board of Directors, Kitsap Economic Development Alliance (KEDA) Board of Directors, and an alternate to the Mayor for the Puget Sound Regional Council (PSRC) Board.

Eric earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in History (University of Minnesota) and a Masters Degree in Business Administration (Eastern Michigan University). He moved to Bremerton in 1997 and is a Certified Public Accountant.   

Eric will continue to advocate for “securing additional money for maintaining and improving our local streets and sidewalks.

Besides ongoing removal of algae at Kitsap Lake Park and safety improvements along or near Kitsap Way, “I plan to place additional emphasis on identifying needed improvements in other parts of the district.”
