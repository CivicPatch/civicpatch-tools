## History

The City Council established the DRA as a special purpose governmental entity in 1997 under RCW 35.21.730-757 with a seven-member Board of Directors appointed by the Council. The DRA Board approves budgets of and provides oversight and guidance to the Hotel and Convention Center project, which is managed by Hilton Corporation.

Candidates with broad business experience are encouraged to apply. Ideal candidates will have experience in property management, project financing, financial management, and contracts. Additionally, experience in the lodging and restaurant fields would be helpful.

The DRA has no employees. The City’s Chief Financial Officer serves as the Executive Director of the Authority, with financial, administrative, and legal support provided by City staff.

The DRA employs an asset management firm specializing in lodging, restaurant, and convention facilities to monitor the ongoing operations of the Hotel/Convention Center and advise the DRA Board on operational, financial, and budget issues.

The DRA owns the Hotel/Convention Center facility. The land upon which the facility is located is leased by the DRA from the Vancouver Public Facilities District, which owns the property.

Meeting Time: Monthly, on the third Thursday of designated months. Meetings begin at 11:00 a.m.
