 1. Public memorial for Mayor Royce Pollard

# Public memorial for Mayor Royce Pollard

## Mayor of “America’s Vancouver”

All are invited to a memorial and community reception for former Mayor Royce Pollard.

Friday, April 11, 5 – 6:30 p.m.

Firstenburg Community Center

Royce Pollard Community Room

Mayor Anne McEnerny-Ogle and City Councilors will be joined by family, friends and former colleagues of Royce Pollard to reflect on, and celebrate the life and times of the former long-time Vancouver Mayor.

Mayor Pollard was a tireless advocate for Vancouver, dedicating his life to its growth and success. As mayor from 1996 to 2010, he played a key role in revitalizing downtown, championing projects like Esther Short Park and the Vancouver Hilton Hotel and Convention Center. 

Before his time in local government, he served in the U.S. Army, including during the Vietnam War, with his final post as Commander of the Vancouver Barracks. 

Many of us had the privilege of firsthand working with Royce and witnessing his passion for this city. His leadership helped shape Vancouver into the place we know today. We are grateful for his impact and inspired to continue his commitment to our community.

 __Mayor Anne McEnerny-Ogle shared these reflections on the former Mayor:__ 

Forty years ago, Royce believed he was being transferred to Vancouver Barracks in Canada. Little did he know, this move would lead him to spend the next 21 years helping our community grow and thrive, raising its profile as America’s Vancouver. When Royce smashed two Portland coffee mugs sold in Vancouver at a coffee shop, newspapers around the Pacific Northwest ran the story.  

Through his work as both a councilor and a mayor, Royce was instrumental in completing several major projects that have shaped the city. Under his leadership, Vancouver saw the annexation of the Vancouver Mall, the historic Cascade Park annexation (the largest in state history), the reconstruction of Esther Short Park, the creation of the Hilton Hotel and Convention Center project, and the planning of the new Vancouver Waterfront. His contributions have left a lasting impact on the city, cementing its place as a vibrant and forward-thinking community.

The changes in the city were symbolic of its revitalization and the renewed spirit ushered in by “The mayor of America’s Vancouver.”
