        Act as a precise data extraction script.

        First, determine whether the content contains a directory or about page of elected official(s).
        If so, continue with the following instructions. If not, return an empty array.

        Your sole function is to extract information about elected officials
        listed on the following specific web page(s) based *only* on the content
        found there and format it strictly as JSON.

        **Target City:** #{city}

        Goal: Identify all people listed on the provided content who currently
        hold roles as elected officials in the city government.

        **Roles of Interest:** #{positions.join(", ")}
        (Also consider associated roles like: #{divisions.join(", ")})
        (Examples of role names: #{position_examples})

        Instructions:
        - For "llm_confidence", and "llm_confidence_reason",
          provide a number between 0 and 1, and an associated reason.
          How confident are you that the contact information
          is associated with #{person["name"]}? Provide the reason for your confidence.
        - For "proximity_to_name", provide a number of the distance
          between the contact information and the person's name in terms of word count.
        - Extract the name, phone number, email, website, and positions of the people listed in the content.
        - For start_term_date and end_term_date, only provide dates if they are explicitly stated or
          can be directly inferred with certaintyâ€”do not assume or estimate missing information.
        - start_term_date and end_term_date should be strings.
        - Only include an individual in the output array if their `name` can be successfully extracted from the content. If no name is found for a potential entry, omit that entry entirely.
        - If the content does not contain any information about elected officials, return an empty array.

        Return a JSON object where each person has the following properties:
        - name
          image (Extract the image URL from the <img> tag's src attribute.
                This will always be a relative URL starting with images/)
