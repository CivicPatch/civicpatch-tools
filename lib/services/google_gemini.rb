        Identify all people who are part of the city's mayor-council government.
        #{city} using #{url} Do this in YAML.
        Positions we are interested in are #{positions.join(", ")}

        Notes:
        * Return the values in YAML.
        * Don't return anything that isn't in YAML.
        * Don't list council members whose terms have ended.

        The YAML should be in this format, in an array:
        - name: <string>
          phone_number: <string> Format: (123) 456-7890
          email: <string>
          positions: [<an array of strings>]
          start_term_date (string. The date the person started their term. Format: YYYY, YYYY-MM, or YYYY-MM-DD)
          end_term_date (string. The date the person ended their term. Format: YYYY, YYYY-MM, or YYYY-MM-DD)
          website: (Provide the absolute URL)

        Basic rules:
        - Extract only the contact information associated with the person. Do not return general info.
        - People should all be human beings with a name and at least one piece of contact field.
        - Output the results in YAML format. For any fields not provided in the content, return an empty string, except for 'name' which is required.
        - If you cannot find any relevant information, return YAML as empty array.

        - To make it on the people list, they must be associated with either "position" OR "position_misc
        - For start_term_date and end_term_date, only provide dates if they are explicitly stated or
          can be directly inferred with certaintyâ€”do not assume or estimate missing information.
          They should be strings.
        - For the "positions" field, split the positions into an array of strings.
          Preserve non-numeric names as they are.
          Do not list previous positions if their terms have ended.
          People can have multiple positions and roles.
          They might have other associated positions that look like these:
          #{divisions.join(", ")}
          Examples:
          #{position_examples}
