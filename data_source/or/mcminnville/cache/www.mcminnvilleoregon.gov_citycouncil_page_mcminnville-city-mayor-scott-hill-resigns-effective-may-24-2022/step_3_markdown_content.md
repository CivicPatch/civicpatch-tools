  [![Mayor Scott A. Hill ](images/1ecaee92260f6e761159669bc00849767013012b842ec88407c95f14e09b508d.jpg)](https://www.mcminnvilleoregon.gov/sites/default/files/styles/gallery500/public/imageattachments/citycouncil/page/23327/mayor_scott_hill_term_to_expire_12.2024.jpg?itok=_T9IgLNm)  

 The City of McMinnville’s Mayor, Scott A. Hill, submitted his [resignation](https://www.mcminnvilleoregon.gov/sites/default/files/fileattachments/city_council/page/23327/resignation.pdf) on April 12, 2022, which will go into effect May 24, 2022. In a [statement](https://www.mcminnvilleoregon.gov/sites/default/files/fileattachments/city_council/page/23327/resignation.pdf) the Mayor said that “much thought and consideration has been spent on this decision and due to extended family health issues and to be closer to family, Donna and I are moving out of state this Spring.”   Mayor Scott A Hill leaves with mixed emotions and has been proud of the many accomplishments and positive changes he and the Council have made.  Highlights include McMinnville Urban Renewal District, the Transportation Bond and their projects, the new Kent Taylor Civic Center and Police Department Building and the expanded Urban Growth Boundary.  He recognized the McMinnville City staff and executive team for their dedicated and hard work and shared his gratitude for the efforts City workers have made to build a community that is livable and sustainable for its citizens.

This seat will be added to the November 8, 2022, General Elections ballot along with the expiring terms of Council positions for Ward 1, Ward 2, and Ward 3.

Ther term of office of the temporary replacement shall begin immediately upon appointment and continue until a permanent replacement is elected. The City Council will take a vote on the replacement at the May 24^(th) City Council meeting and will assume the mayoral duties, as identified in the City Charter, after Mayor Hill’s resignation becomes effective on May 24, 2022. 

 The City Council is comprised of seven members elected by positions, in staggered general election years. In November 2022, three Council positions (Wards 1 2, & 3), as well as the position of mayor will be open for election. The newly elected Mayor shall take office at the first regular meeting of the council occurring after the election. The term of office of the elected replacement shall be the unexpired term of December 31, 2024. The Council positions will take office at the January 10, 2023, meeting.
