# McMinnville Affordable Housing Committee

In September 2016, the City Council determined the best way to assist Citizens who are experiencing homelessness or who are on the verge of losing their current home was to increase housing availability for low and no-income families. To support this policy, the Council directed the formation of a 9 member Affordable Housing Committee and charged them with the task of developing an action plan to meet this focus.

The Advisory Housing Committee serves in an advisory role to the City Council and is enabled by [Chapter 2.31](https://www.mcminnvilleoregon.gov/sites/default/files/fileattachments/mcminnville_affordable_housing_committee/page/272/ordinance_no._5100.pdf) of the McMinnville Municipal Code.
