#  Sherwood City Councilor Russell Griffin announced his resignation from Sherwood City Council 

 News Release Date 02-21-2022  [Back to News](https://www.sherwoodoregon.gov/news)  

Sherwood City Councilor Russell Griffin announced his resignation from the Sherwood City Council. In his resignation, Councilor Griffin noted that the time was right to step away and that this decision would allow him to spend more time with his family.

Councilor Kim Young had this to say about the Russell: “I’m sad to see Russell Griffin resign from City Council but respect his decision on doing what’s best for him and his family. Russell has been an exceptional City Councilor and he will be missed. Russell is a long time Sherwood resident and has served our community in a variety of ways. His role as a prior Planning Commissioner brought with him a wealth of history and knowledge to his role as a City Councilor. Russell is a man of integrity, and I have the utmost respect for him. I have truly enjoyed serving with Russell and he will be missed on Council but am thankful that we also have a friendship that will continue beyond Council. I wish Russell the best as he moves on.”

Russell moved to Sherwood in 1997 and has been an active member of the community. He was a founding member of the Voices for the Performing Arts and sang in the Sherwood Chorale for more than ten years. Russell has been involved in each summer musical production put on by the Sherwood Foundation for the Arts in Stella Olsen Park.

Sherwood Mayor Keith Mays said, “I have had the pleasure of working with (or observing) Russell for close to 20 years as he volunteered his time supporting our town’s community groups and city committees.  On City Council, I am thankful that he has been a strong advocate of our goals, including but not limited to economic development, the pedestrian bridge, Sherwood Broadband, the Festival Plaza, and our rapid response to help with Covid-19.”

During his time in Sherwood, Russell has been generous with his time and energy in the community as a volunteer for Robin Hood Festival, Cruisin’ Sherwood, the Holiday Festival, the Onion Festival, SHS Grad Night, SOLVE Oregon, the Boy Scouts, and his church.

Council President Tim Rosener said, “Russel Griffin is a man that wears many hats. A councilor, community volunteer, and instigator of positive change are just a few of the roles he has played in our community. His pragmatic, collaborative and sometimes passionate approach to City Council and governance was truly an asset as we worked together on making Sherwood the best city in Oregon. I wish him well in his next great endeavor!”

Russell began his service to the City of Sherwood in 2005 with his appointment to the Planning Commission. Russell served as a Planning Commissioner until his appointment to the City Council in October of 2017. In March of 2018, Russell was elected to complete the remainder of the term. In November of 2018, Russell was re-elected to a full term on the City Council.

“While reviewing applications as a Planning Commissioner, Russell Griffin’s constructive attitude, attention to details, and compassion for Sherwood resulted in positive outcomes for our community.  It a was a pleasure to have served with Councilor Griffin,” stated Jean Simson, Planning Commissioner Chair.

During his tenure with Sherwood, Russell has served on the Comprehensive Plan Citizen’s Advisory Committee, the Sherwood Center for the Arts CAC, and the City’s Budget Committee. Russell also served as the Council liaison to the Parks and Recreation Board and the Robin Hood Festival Committee.

The Sherwood City Council and the Sherwood City staff want to thank Russell for his service to our community and wish him the very best.
