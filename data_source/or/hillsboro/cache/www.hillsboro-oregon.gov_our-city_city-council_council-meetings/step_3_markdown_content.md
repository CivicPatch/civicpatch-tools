 Report a Public Meetings Law Violation  **  

In the 2023 session, the Legislative Assembly passed [HB 2805](https://olis.oregonlegislature.gov/liz/2023R1/Downloads/MeasureDocument/HB2805/Enrolled) , which gives the [Oregon Government Ethics Commission (OGEC)](https://www.oregon.gov/ogec/Pages/laws.aspx) the authority to enforce [Oregon's Public Meetings Law](https://www.oregon.gov/ogec/public-meetings-law/pages/default.aspx) (ORS 192.610 to 192.705)

City Council, including all board, commissions and committees, are subject to Oregon’s Public Meeting Law. Violations of the law should be reported through the grievance process outlined by state law and the OGEC. To report a violation, [email the City Recorder’s Office](https://www.hillsboro-oregon.gov/our-city/departments/city-manager-s-office/city-records-city-recorder/contact-the-city-recorder-s-office) or provide a written grievance to 150 East Main Street, 5th floor, Hillsboro, Oregon 97123. Once received, the City Recorder’s Office will initiate the process as outlined by the OGEC.

 __Step 1- The written grievance needs to include:__ 

 * Date of submission of the grievance.
 * The name and contact information of the person filing the grievance.
 * The date that the alleged violation of the Public Meetings Law occurred.
 * A description of the facts and circumstances of the alleged violation. 

The written grievance must be submitted to the City Recorder's Office within 30 calendar days of when the alleged violation happened. 

 __ Step 2 - Wait for Response__ 

The City Recorder's Office has 21 calendar days to respond to your written grievance. The response should acknowledge the receipt of the written grievance and address it in one of the following ways:

 * Deny the facts and circumstances alleged in the grievance. Provide the public body's version of events and why those facts are not a violation of the law.
 * Admit to the facts and circumstances alleged in the grievance, but deny that they are a violation of the law.
 * Admit to the facts and circumstances alleged in the grievance and that they were a violation of the law. Explain the steps the City of Hillsboro will take to address the violation.
 * Once you receive a response from the City Recorder's Office, or if you do not receive a response within 21 days of filing your grievance, you can move on to filing a complaint with OGEC.

 __Step 3 - File Complaint__ 

If you receive a response that satisfies your grievance, you do not need to file a complaint.

If you don't receive a response within 21 days, or if you are dissatisfied with response you received, you can file a complaint with OGEC. To file a complaint with OGEC, you are required to include documentation that you have completed the mandatory prerequisites (steps 1 and 2). You can submit a complaint on the [Cases & Complaints web page](https://www.oregon.gov/ogec/public-records/pages/complaints.aspx).

You must include the following with your complaint:

 * A copy of the written grievance.
 * A copy of the City Recorder's response.

If no response was received, an affirmation that you did not receive a response within the 21-day period. If you fail to satisfy the mandatory prerequisites before filing your complaint with OGEC, your complaint will be dismissed. (ORS 192.685(3))
