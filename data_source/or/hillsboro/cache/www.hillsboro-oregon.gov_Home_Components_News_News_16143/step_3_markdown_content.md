“I am filled with immense gratitude and a profound sense of responsibility,” Pace said upon her election to a four-year term. “I have just been elected as only the second woman and first LGBTQIA+ person to serve as mayor in Hillsboro’s 148-year history. Hillsboro is a place where everyone belongs, and it is our duty to ensure there is space and a place for everyone in this vibrant and diverse community.”

## 3 New City Councilors

### Ward 1, Position B

 __Saba Anvery__ ran unopposed and will join the Council on January 7, 2025.

 ![Saba Anvery 2024](images/009b8597d2e236594fe16d8d5ff5cb13358ba7210042a00ccbe934b088386f18.jpg) 

“I believe it is my responsibility to give back to this wonderful city as best as I can,” said Anvery, who works at Intel. “I am a problem solver. As an engineer and an engineering manager, I have learned that the best solutions come from collaboration and listening to every voice. I am committed to working with the community, listening to every voice, and finding solutions that benefit everyone and ensure Hillsboro's future readiness.”

Councilor-elect Anvery will fill the position being vacated by Councilor Rick Van Beveren who was ineligible to run again due to term limits. Van Beveren has served on the Council for more than 9 years after being appointed to the Ward 1, Position B seat in 2015, then winning election in 2016 and 2020.

### Ward 2, Position B

 __Elizabeth Case__ received 17,977 votes in a 3-person race to represent Ward 2 on the City Council.

“I have never loved where I live as much as I love living in Hillsboro,” said Case, who owns a small business marketing firm. “I am serving because I have seen firsthand how thoughtful leadership and planning has led to the exponential growth and expansion of our city and helped us to become the economic engine of the state.”

Councilor-elect Case will replace former Council President Anthony Martin, who also was limited by term limits after eight years on the City Council.

### Ward 3, Position B

 __Rob Harris__ received 22,363 votes in a 2-person race to represent Ward 3 on the Council.

“I have always felt it was a blessing to be able to serve my community,” said Harris, an experienced attorney and former prosecutor. “I am well aware of the challenges and opportunities Hillsboro is facing over the next few years, so when a Council seat opened up, I thought my many years of experience, deep knowledge of this community, and my skill set could be useful to the Council in navigating some challenging issues.”

Councilor-elect Harris will fill the seat being vacated by Councilor Gina Sanchez-Roletto, who opted not to run for re-election after four years of service on the Council.

## Returning Councilors

The newly elected leaders will join Councilors __Olivia Alcaire__ and __Kipperlyn Sinclair__ on the Council.
