## City Council Spotlight: Councilor Anthony Martin

 __ ![2017 Council Swearing-in Ceremony (photo by Rick Paulson)](images/ee211c637de1fa0a9f8a284ed1405dcf42c77956bf8034f3af7d5422596c456e.jpg) Council experience:__ Anthony was first elected to the Hillsboro City Council in November 2016 and re-elected in November 2020. His current term expires in January 2025. ____ 

 __Community experience:__ Anthony has lived in Hillsboro since 2015 and in the area his whole life. He enjoys volunteering and loves HillsDOer Day. Anthony also enjoys supporting local businesses and is a member of the Hillsboro Food Co-Op. He and his wife Amanda (pictured lower left) love attending community events, exploring Hillsboro’s parks and trails, and eating at every restaurant in Hillsboro. Anthony also loves playing musical instruments, including the ukulele and the banjo.

 __Education and work experience:__ Anthony graduated from Banks High School and lived in Buxton on a goat farm. He then received his bachelor’s degree in Spanish and political science from the University of Oregon. Anthony worked as a commercial fisherman in southeast Alaska as a way to pay for college. He then received his master’s degree in public affairs from the University of Texas at Austin, where he focused on local government. Anthony worked as a financial and economic consultant for cities in the Pacific Northwest. He now works as a financial analyst for the City of Portland.

 __Why serve on the Hillsboro City Council?__ 

“I am proud to call Hillsboro my home and I want to help our community. I see government, especially local government, as the best way to make an impact on my community. I believe that community is created when people put more into a community than they get out of it themselves, and I want to contribute to that. I also want to bring every voice to local government so we can work better together.”

 __What are your hopes and goals?__ 

One of my goals is to make life better for people. I hope to get to live in a world where there is far less suffering than there is now. I want to help lead the City into a more sustainable future in all senses of the word (environmental, economic, social). As former City Manager Michael Brown always said, “The City is here forever, and we need to act like it.” I want to reinforce and strengthen the community in Hillsboro.

 __What should Hillsboro residents know about how you serve the community?__ 

“I am always available to talk with about City issues. Whether it’s through email, on the phone, or on the street, please reach out to me and we will see how to work together and make positive change in our community. My e-mail is [Anthony.Martin@Hillsboro-Oregon.gov](mailto:anthony.martin@hillsboro-oregon.gov). Everyone in our City is a leader and can add something to make Hillsboro better.”
