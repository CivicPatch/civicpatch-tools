## Year-Round Shelter Construction is Now Underway

 Post Date: 01/16/2025 

 [Lea este artículo en español](https://www.hillsboro-oregon.gov/Home/Components/News/News/16276/3561).

 ![Excavator in action at future year-round shelter site](images/7544a556ea4021424799df47d9f6eb880252d93c45027d164dcac4d73cdc26ae.jpg) 

Construction activity is underway on [SW 17th Avenue near Winco & Dairy Creek Park](https://www.google.com/maps/place/311+SW+17th+Ave,+Hillsboro,+OR+97123/@45.5191423,-123.0071901,17z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x54951a91bd6fccb5:0x13247a1675748a07!8m2!3d45.5194929!4d-123.0080719) as the City of Hillsboro and Washington County work to create Hillsboro’s first permanent [year-round shelter](https://engage.hillsboro-oregon.gov/yearroundshelter) for adults experiencing homelessness. 

Since construction began on January 6, two vacant buildings on the property that were unsuitable for reuse have been demolished and temporary fencing is complete.

Elected officials and City & County leaders will celebrate the groundbreaking in early March.

The future shelter will meet critical community needs by offering __safe sleeping spaces, meals, wrap-around support, and housing assessments__ to connect guests with pathways to long-term housing support.

Planned amenities & services include:

 ![Artist rendering of future year-round shelter indoor sleeping spaces with privacy curtains](images/860ab330d47a98e07e7fb8cd36de69dc7694ae7331764c22d38666c5813fba82.jpg) 

 * Safe sleeping spaces for up to __75 guests__ :  

   *  __35 indoor sleeping areas__ in a congregate setting    

   *  __40 individual shelter pods__     

 * Culturally-responsive & trauma-informed support through __24/7 onsite staff__   

 * Onsite __mental, behavioral, and physical health services__   

 *  __Centralized location__ with access to public transportation, employment opportunities, food, medical care, and nearby support services  

 * A warming kitchen, communal dining area, and __computer access__   

 * Bathrooms, showers, __laundry, and storage__ for personal belongings  

 *  __Outdoor seating, recreation, and pet areas__ 

Once open, the shelter will be operated by a service provider and funded through Washington County's allocation of the [Supportive Housing Services Measure](https://www.oregonmetro.gov/public-projects/supportive-housing-services). 

### Engaging Our Community 

 ![Artist rendering of future year-round shelter community room](images/d7724f691f92fd2cc6397735182fdf423b8eb5575c58d6f1d8ea9b4c93b2c2f8.jpg) 

Plans for the shelter's design, architecture, and amenities have been informed by community engagement through [stakeholder focus groups and a community-wide survey](https://engage.hillsboro-oregon.gov/yearroundshelter/news_feed/spring-2024-feedback-report). See the  [July 2024 artist renderings](https://www.hillsboro-oregon.gov/home/showpublisheddocument/30969/638568213172270000)  to explore the design.

Community input will continue to shape: 

 * Operator selection & qualifications  

 * Elements of the shelter's [Neighborhood Plan](https://www.washingtoncountyor.gov/housing/homeless-services-division/neighborhood-plans) 

We're also inviting community members to [ask us a question](https://engage.hillsboro-oregon.gov/yearroundshelter?tool=qanda) and sharing those questions and our responses on [Engage Hillsboro](https://engage.hillsboro-oregon.gov/yearroundshelter).

The temporary [Safe Rest Pods on SW 17th Avenue](https://www.hillsboro-oregon.gov/services/community-support/homelessness-initiatives/shelters) provided emergency shelter at the project site while year-round shelter development moved forward.

During two rounds of operation, the Safe Rest Pods: 

 * Provided __emergency shelter for 196 community members__   

 *  __Connected 178 guests to housing assessments__ 

The Pods closed at the end of October to clear the property for construction. Washington County is storing the portable shelters while exploring opportunities for future locations.

### Next Steps

 * The City of Hillsboro & Washington County will open a Request for Proposals for a shelter operator in the coming weeks.  

 * Operator selection is expected to conclude by late spring.  

 *  [Neighborhood Plan](https://www.washingtoncountyor.gov/housing/homeless-services-division/neighborhood-plans) community engagement is planned for next summer.

The shelter is expected to welcome its first guests in winter 2025-26 following a community open house.
