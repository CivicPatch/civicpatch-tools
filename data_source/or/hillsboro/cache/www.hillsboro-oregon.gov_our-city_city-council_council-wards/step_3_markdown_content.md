  [Print]()  [Feedback]()   [Font Size:]()  [+]()  [-]()

## New Interactive Map

Use the [interactive City Council Wards Map](https://www.hillsboro-oregon.gov/services/maps/council-wards) to locate your ward and explore the updated boundaries. 

## Updated Boundaries

Hillsboro City Council adopted  [new ward boundaries](https://www.hillsboro-oregon.gov/services/maps/council-wards)  on January 3, 2023.

 * The new boundaries were informed by community engagement and recommended by graduates of the [2022 Civic Leadership Academy](https://www.hillsboro-oregon.gov/our-city/commissions-committees-boards/civic-leadership-academy) , who spent six weeks working with Portland State University (PSU) to develop their proposal.

 *  [Ordinance 6411](https://hillsboro-oregon.civicweb.net/document/55199/Ordinance%20No.%206441.pdf?handle=594E74E010734EAD8C2C526070779146)  is in effect and applicable for upcoming elections.

Hillsboro embarked on the ward update after results of the 2020 U.S. Census showed imbalanced population counts between the three wards.

 Ward Boundary Update Process  **  

 * In October 2021, the City Council determined the City's Civic Leadership Academy would serve as the Citizen Review Board Blue Ribbon Committee to follow the extensive adjustment process.  

 * The City worked with Oregon's Kitchen Table, a program of PSU, to engage with more than 600 community members in a variety of settings to gather residents' input and feedback. Results are available below.  

 * Hillsboro City Council updated the ward boundary criteria in September 2022 to meet statewide legal requirements and include collected community input.

 * The City worked with Portland State University (PSU), to develop initial proposed maps that helped inform the Civic Leadership Academy's recommendation.  

 * Civic Leadership Academy graduates presented their proposed ward boundaries to Hillsboro City Council in November 2022. [Ordinance 6433](https://hillsboro-oregon.civicweb.net/document/52507/1.%20Ordinance%20No.%206433.pdf?handle=C6384FEFD0324B4B9A5E9CE3DB96F376) adopting the revised boundaries was approved by first reading on December 6, 2022 and second reading on January 3, 2023.  

 * When updating the interactive map, staff recommended revising the ordinance language to clarify the intent of the Civic Leadership Academy’s recommendation. [Ordinance 6433](https://hillsboro-oregon.civicweb.net/document/52507/1.%20Ordinance%20No.%206433.pdf?handle=C6384FEFD0324B4B9A5E9CE3DB96F376)  was repealed and  replaced by  [Ordinance 6411](https://hillsboro-oregon.civicweb.net/document/55199/Ordinance%20No.%206441.pdf?handle=594E74E010734EAD8C2C526070779146) on March 7, 2023.

## Community Engagement

Your voices are important! Your input guided the changes to the boundaries and helped people find out about city services, programs, and decision-making.

 Civic Leadership Academy  **  

2022 Hillsboro Civic Leadership Academy members presented recommendations for new Hillsboro City Council Ward boundaries during the November 15 City Council Work Session.

Thirteen Academy members spent six weeks meeting with key stakeholders, reviewing 2020 Census data, and reviewing boundary criteria passed by City Council based on the community engagement conducted earlier this year. 

 [Visit the Civic Leadership Academy webpage](https://www.hillsboro-oregon.gov/our-city/commissions-committees-boards/civic-leadership-academy) to learn more.

 Community Engagement Results  **  

Together, the City of Hillsboro and Oregon’s Kitchen Table hosted a variety of engagement activities, including:

 * Two public forums
 * An online survey in four languages (Chinese, English, Spanish and Vietnamese)
 * Community conversations
 * Nine culturally-specific and community festivals and events

About 620 people participated in the engagement activities. Based on the results of the public engagement process, recommendations have been developed for criteria to guide redrawing the City of Hillsboro’s Council Ward Boundaries.
