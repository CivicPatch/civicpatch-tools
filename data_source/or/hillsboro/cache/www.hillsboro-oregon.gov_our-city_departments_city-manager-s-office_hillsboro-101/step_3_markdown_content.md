For more than 90 years, the City of Hillsboro has utilized the Council-Manager form of government. Voters approved this form of government through the City of Hillsboro Charter, Hillsboro’s constitution, to create an exceptional place to live.

 Understanding our Form of Government  **  

### What is a Council-Manager form of government?

The City Manager serves at the pleasure of the City Council, the elected representatives of the people, to effectively deliver the services that the Council prioritizes for the City. The Council-Manager system often leads to lower costs through improved productivity and efficient service delivery, and the effective use of technology. In addition, the local economy benefits from improved business development and retention strategies.

The City Manager makes policy recommendations to the City Council, who decide whether to move forward on those recommendations. The Council also approves the budget, sets goals for the community, and evaluates the performance of the City Manager.

Because political power is concentrated in the entire Council rather than one elected official, more residents have an opportunity to serve the community in elected leadership.

### What role does the Mayor play?

As a member of the City Council, the Mayor is a key political leader and policy developer, leading meetings and speaking on behalf of the community. The Mayor also facilitates communications between elected leaders and represents the City in discussions with other cities and governments.

### What role do the Councilors play?

For the purposes of civic representation on the City Council, the City is divided into three wards, with two councilors residing within each ward. All councilors represent the entire City once elected. Councilors are elected to four-year terms, and no person may serve more than two consecutive terms. Candidates must be registered voters in the State of Oregon who have resided in the City during the 12 months immediately preceding the election. Terms begin at the first City Council meeting of the calendar year following election, where the Oath of Office is administered.

### What role do other community members play?

Residents and other stakeholders play a vital role in the decision-making process by electing representatives to the Council, by volunteering on advisory Boards and Commissions, by attending meetings, and by participating in planning for the City’s future, including the Hillsboro 2035 Community Plan.

 Council Rules  **  

City Charter Sections 11, 12 and 13 require the City Council to adopt rules by resolution to govern its meetings. The City Council held discussions at City Council work sessions on February 4, 2025 and March 18, 2025 and at a retreat on March 8, 2025 and discussed revisions to the Council Rules that were originally adopted on December 2, 2008.

 Ethics  **  

## Oregon Government Ethics Commission:

The Oregon Government Ethics Commission (OGEC), established by vote of the people in 1974, is a seven-member citizen commission charged with enforcing government ethics laws. Oregon government ethic laws prohibit public officials from using office for financial gain, and require public disclosure of economic conflicts of interest. The OGEC also enforces state laws that require lobbyists and the entities they represent to register and periodically report their expenditures. The third area of OGEC jurisdiction is the executive session provisions of public meetings law.
