 __What are your hopes and goals?__ 

 ____ 

 ____ "Knowing that every decision we make now, as a Council, makes a difference for years to come, my goals and hopes are to put Hillsboro in the position to continue to be economically viable, have an infrastructure that is prepared for continued population growth, is a community that is educationally strong by supporting PCC and HSD, make sure our City’s 2035 Community Plan is implemented, and provide the safe community that will attract new families and retain our current residents."

 __What should Hillsboro residents know about how you serve the community as a Council member?__ 

"It is an honor and privilege to serve our City in this capacity. Addressing quality of life issues will continue to be a priority: Community safety and sidewalks, strong schools and opportunities for our youth, parks and libraries, transportation and jobs, and the Hillsboro 2035 Community Plan. Hillsboro is a great city. I will continue to focus on making our future just as great as our past.

The most important way to contribute is by being accessible and listening to the voices of Hillsboro — and making those voices heard. The conversations in the grocery store aisles, at Hops games, in living rooms, at schools, coffee shops, and at our markets, help me understand different perspectives and make sure that all opinions are known and considered."
