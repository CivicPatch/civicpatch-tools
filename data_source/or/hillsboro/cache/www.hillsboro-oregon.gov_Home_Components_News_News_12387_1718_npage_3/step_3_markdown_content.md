## Councilor Spotlight: Gina Sanchez Roletto

 __ ![City Councilor Gina Roletto](images/20fccdc865a41570f608fd2d1fb1e8812468f0ac83049f5ce3b076900cb272a3.jpg) Council Experience:__ 

Gina was elected to the Council in November 2020 and began her four-year term in January 2021.

 __Community Experience:__ 

Gina has lived in Hillsboro for over 20 years. She mentors aspiring Latino/Latina leaders to meet their personal and professional goals as a board member and former president of the Oregon Association of Latino Administrators.

 __Education & Work Experience:__ 

Gina graduated from high school in Yakima, Washington. She received a bachelor’s degree and a master’s degree from the University of Washington. Gina currently works as a school administrator in Portland Public Schools.

She previously worked as an educator in the Hillsboro School District in positions that include classroom teaching at the K-6 level, coordinating Migrant Summer School, and helping open South Meadows Middle School as the Dean of Students.

 *"As a Latina woman, I borrow from my lived experiences and champion for others and their success through mentorship. I plan to use my experiences as a Council member to bring more residents into the process to help shape our community."*
