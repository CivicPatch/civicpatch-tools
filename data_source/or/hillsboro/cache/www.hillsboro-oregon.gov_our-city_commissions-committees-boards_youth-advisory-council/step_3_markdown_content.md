This event brings together City leaders, elected officials, and youth from across the country to engage in discussions on policy issues, leadership development, and advocacy at the federal level. Through a competitive application process, Hillsboro YAC members are selected to attend as youth delegates, representing the voice of Hillsboro's younger generation.

In addition to participating in workshops and networking with peers and national leaders, YAC members have the chance to explore Washington, D.C., and learn more about the nation’s capital. They visit landmarks, experience the rich history of the city, and gain a deeper understanding of the federal legislative process. This experience allows them to return to Hillsboro with new insights and ideas to strengthen their contributions as youth leaders in their community.
