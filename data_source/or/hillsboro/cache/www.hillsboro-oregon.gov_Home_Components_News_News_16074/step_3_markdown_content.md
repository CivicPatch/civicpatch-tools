## Mayor Callaway Receives League of Oregon Cities Award

 Post Date: 10/21/2024 

Hillsboro Mayor Steve Callaway has been recognized once again for his outstanding leadership and service in Oregon.

The most recent honor comes from the League of Oregon Cities (LOC), which [awarded Mayor Callaway the prestigious James C. Richards Award](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gq_BhmAEHEk) during the LOC's 99^(th) annual conference in October. The award is given to an elected city official who serves the citizens of Oregon through an exceptional personal investment in intergovernmental affairs.

“I’m very honored to be recognized by my peers in this manner. It is truly humbling," Mayor Callaway said. "I am proud of what Hillsboro has accomplished, and that as I’ve served the city, I’ve also been able to support other Oregon communities through my service with the League of Oregon Cities.”

 ![Mayor Callaway Receives LOC Richards Award 2024 ](images/3fe4ad044f48a73cb3340d8c4b8f7a79b522679cd6aae0b383bcce1777024e43.jpg) 

From [the League of Oregon Cities award announcement](https://www.orcities.org/application/files/3517/2954/1124/2024_Richards_Award_News_Release-FINAL.pdf) :

 *"Before joining the Hillsboro City Council in 2011, then becoming Hillsboro's mayor in 2016, Mayor Callaway served on the Hillsboro Budget Committee, 2020 Vision Committee, Planning Commission, Library Foundation, the Oregon International Air Show, and the Hillsboro Schools Foundation.* 

 *In leading a community where people of color represent more than 40% of the population, Mayor Callaway has been a strong advocate for diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI). His efforts have been recognized by The League of Minority Voters and Centro Cultural.* 

 *Under his leadership, Hillsboro has earned consistent national recognition as a “best place” to live and work. In 2022, the City of Hillsboro was named Public Employer of the Year by the Oregon Resource Association for creating an inviting and equitable work environment for employees with disabilities.* 

 *Mayor Callaway’s positive impact has reached communities throughout Oregon, where he’s helped countless elected leaders while serving on the board of directors and as president of both the Oregon Mayors Association and the League of Oregon Cities."* 

James C. Richards was a city councilor for Bay City, Oregon, and was the administrative officer for Tillamook County. His many years of involvement in intergovernmental affairs serve as a model for others and is the standard by which nominees are evaluated.

### Oregon Mayors Association Recognized Mayor Callaway

In July, the Oregon Mayors Association (OMA) recognized Mayor Callaway with the Award of Merit for his leadership and service. Mayor Callaway was one of two mayors (along with North Plains Mayor Teri Lenahan) to receive the Award of Merit for his many contributions to the Hillsboro community and throughout the State of Oregon during his eight years in office.

First elected Mayor in November 2016, Mayor Callaway took office in January 2017 and was re-elected in November 2020.

#### Read Mayor Callaway's OMA Award nomination letter from the Hillsboro City Council

 *"We are delighted to nominate Hillsboro Mayor Steve Callaway for the OMA Mayor’s Leadership Award.* 

 *While 2024 is his final year in office, Mayor Callaway’s legacy of accomplishments, achievements, and contributions to the greater Hillsboro community will be remembered for years and decades to come. His positive impact is felt in communities throughout Oregon. Steve has helped countless elected leaders during his time in office and while serving in leadership of the Oregon Mayors Association and the League of Oregon Cities.* 

 *First elected to the Hillsboro City Council in November 2010 and re-elected in 2014, Steve was elected Mayor in 2016 and re-elected in 2020. Mayor Callaway has championed initiatives to make Hillsboro a better place _for everyone_ to live, work, and play. From inclusion and equity, to safety and sustainability, community events and connectivity, to education and economic opportunities, Hillsboro is better – more welcoming and friendlier – because of Mayor Callaway and his dedication to public service. His ability to work countless hours in service to the community while maintaining an extraordinary sense of humor and connection with people is nothing short of remarkable.* 

 *Having lived in Hillsboro for more than 30 years, Mayor Callaway has always appreciated Hillsboro as a great place to live. He and his wife Joan raised their children here and have served the community for decades in order to help ensure Hillsboro remains a wonderful place for the next generation of families, including his grandchildren. Steve has a gift for connecting with kids and supporting their leadership growth. He will meet with any student who reaches out, visits dozens of classrooms each year to read books aloud, and delights in sharing his enthusiasm and encouragement for youth in Hillsboro.* 

 *Back when he was known as Principal Callaway, Steve initially ran for City Council because he wanted to continue his involvement in and service to Hillsboro with the experience he gained while serving on Hillsboro’s Budget Committee, the Hillsboro 2020 Vision Implementation Committee, the Hillsboro Planning Commission, the Jackson Bottom Wetlands Preserve Board, the Library Foundation of Hillsboro, the Oregon International Air Show, the 53rd Avenue Community Park Task Force, and the Hillsboro Schools Foundation. And that was all BEFORE he joined the City Council in 2011.* 

 *Known for his ability to relate to residents regardless of the situation, Mayor Callaway is a compassionate leader who connects with people on a personal level. Often times, he finds himself choking up when recognizing a resident or City staff member, or when celebrating a meaningful acknowledgement or presenting an award to a student.*
