# A Message from the Mayor

 __Memorial Day Message__ 

 *Honoring our heroes* 

Memorial Day will be observed later this month. This day has significant importance as we remember and honor the brave men and women who made the ultimate sacrifice in the line of duty.

I am always moved by the stories of courage and dedication exhibited by our Armed Forces. Their efforts are a testament to the strength and resilience of our nation and their commitment to our country has ensured our freedoms and safeguarded our way of life.

As Mayor, I am committed to ensuring that the legacy of our fallen heroes is honored and upheld. I also want to highlight the families who have experienced firsthand the weight of these heroes’ sacrifice.

On behalf of the City of Happy Valley, I extend my deepest gratitude to our servicemen and servicewomen. Thank you for your service, your sacrifice, and your commitment to our country.

For those wishing to honor our fallen heroes, I encourage you to visit the Happy Valley Veterans Memorial Park, located adjacent to City Hall. This is a wonderful place to peacefully reflect and honor the memory of the brave individuals who sacrificed their lives for our country.

Mayor Ellis
