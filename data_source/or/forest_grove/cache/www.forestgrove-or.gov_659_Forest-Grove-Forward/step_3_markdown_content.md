## Your Voice, Your Vision

What do you see for the future of Forest Grove? A community vision is an opportunity to think BIG and be creative to explore and develop shared solutions for broad goals and challenges. Whether it is thinking about our local economy, housing, transportation and mobility, infrastructure, health and wellness, or arts and culture – we want to hear from you! Community members play a vital role in defining and inspiring our shared vision. Thank you for your desire to participate and contribute to shaping Forest Grove’s future.

## Vision Labs

Since June 2024, the City of Forest Grove has been actively engaging the community to develop a plan to shape the city’s look, feel, and functionality over the next 15 years.

Thousands of ideas were gathered from community members through outreach, which included interviews, community group meetings, online surveys, numerous community events and more.  These ideas were analyzed and categorized into five key goal areas:

 1.  __Economy- __ Supporting local businesses, downtown revitalization, commercial and industrial development; beautification.
 1.  __Community Growth- __ Housing design and growth, school facilities and education quality, public safety, and City services to meet the needs of the growing population.
 1.  __Healthy and Active Community- __ Parks, trails, open spaces, and recreation opportunities.
 1.  __Sustainable Infrastructure- __ Roads, mobility around town, traffic safety, signage; utilities, city facilities.
 1.  __Community Connection- __ Community events; communications; volunteering; gathering spaces.

### Each goal area will have 2 Vision Labs:

 1. During the first meeting, we will present the findings from our community outreach and discuss defining success for this goal area.
 1. At the second meeting, we will evaluate and refine our ideas through a structured review of community input. The goal is to develop a targeted set of actions to drive success in this goal area. We will discuss strategies for prioritizing these actions and identify potential community partners to support implementation.

## Vision Lab Participants

Everyone is invited to participate! The Vision Labs will include interested community members, subject matter experts, members from the Forest Grove Forward Steering Committee, elected officials, members of the City’s Boards and Commissions, and representatives from community partner organizations. __ __

 1.  [Why are we developing a community vision now?](https://www.forestgrove-or.gov/659/Forest-Grove-Forward/) 

Forest Grove is a wonderful place to live, work, learn, and play. Our community has grown nearly 25% over the last decade and is projected to increase to 33,600 people by 2045. As our community continues to grow, we want to make sure that growth is aligned with community needs and priorities. Now is a great opportunity to pause, reflect, and think about our vision, goals, and how to strategically align our resources to best serve our community.

 1.  [Who is involved in the strategic planning process?](https://www.forestgrove-or.gov/659/Forest-Grove-Forward/) 

The City of Forest Grove is leading this project with the support of the City Council, Steering Committee, and staff. We have partnered with a consulting team to guide our organization in the visioning process and gather perspectives from across the community to ensure everyone has a chance to share ideas and help shape the future.

 1.  [How can I get involved?](https://www.forestgrove-or.gov/659/Forest-Grove-Forward/)

 *  __Stay engaged throughout the process!__ We are committed to an open and transparent process that provides multiple opportunities for community members to provide input and share their feedback on the development of the vision. The community vision will guide decision making so we want to make sure we get it right!

 1.  [What is the timeline of Forest Grove Forward?](https://www.forestgrove-or.gov/659/Forest-Grove-Forward/)
