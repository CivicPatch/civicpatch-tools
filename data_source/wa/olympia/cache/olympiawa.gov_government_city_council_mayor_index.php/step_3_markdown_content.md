  ![2025-Council-Header](images/d70896cb153f5f848a61bc1aeddd091e21e0951869c8d8ba9948aef56353a3e4.2025-Council-Header.jpg) 

## About the Olympia City Council

Olympia's City Councilmembers are part-time City employees. They devote, on average, 15-25 hours per week to Council business. Some Councilmembers have full time business and employment careers in addition to their duties on the City Council.

The seven members on Olympia's City Council are elected to four year terms from the community as-a-whole, not from districts or wards. The positions are non-partisan. The terms are staggered, with positions ending for three members at one time and four members the next. Olympia City Council elections are part of the Thurston County general election held in odd-numbered years.

Position 1 is designated as the Mayor's position. The Mayor is elected by the citizens to that position. In Olympia, the Mayor and Councilmembers have equal voting authority, with the Mayor voting on all issues as one of seven Councilmembers.

Annually, the City Council selects one of its members to be Mayor Pro Tem so that there is a previously designated Councilmember to assume the Mayor's duties if needed.

 __Comment via Zoom__ 

Providing public comment through Zoom requires advanced registration by 4:30 p.m. the day of the meeting. A registration link is included in the meeting packets on our [Agendas & Minutes page](https://olympia.legistar.com/Calendar.aspx).

Once connected to the meeting you will be auto-muted. You will however be able to view and hear the meeting. At the start of the public comment period, the Mayor will call participants by name in the order they signed up to speak and you will then be unmuted when it is your turn. You will have two minutes to speak. Note that you do not have to use video, you may comment by audio only.
