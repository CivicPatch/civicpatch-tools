## City councilmember Ty Stober appointed to lead National League of Cities’ “REAL” Council; Councilmember Diana Perez reappointed as “REAL” member

February 14, 2024

Vancouver City Councilor Ty Stober has been appointed Co-Chair for the  [National League of Cities](http://www.nlc.org)  (NLC) 2024 Race, Equity And Leadership (REAL) Council. Stober was appointed to a one-year term to develop and guide programs among local elected officials for America’s cities, towns and villages. The appointment was announced by NLC President David Sander, Mayor-Elect of Rancho Cordova, CA. 

“The REAL Council has been an important resource as I navigate decisions that affect all residents of Vancouver,” Councilor Stober said. “I have learned so much from the training provided and the relationships developed through the Council. I feel so honored to be chosen as a Co-Chair for 2024.”

As a leader of NLC’s REAL Council, Stober will play a key role among a diverse group of local leaders to encourage collaboration, networking and the development of resources and programs beneficial to communities that share demographics, size or location that can be replicated across the country.

Joining Stober on NLC’s REAL Council in 2024 is fellow Vancouver City Councilmember Diana Perez. Perez, who was initially elected to the REAL Council in 2023, has been reappointed as a member for her second one-year term to develop and guide programs among local elected officials from similar communities. 

“I look forward to continuing this collaboration with colleagues on a national scale, working to advance equity, advocate for solutions to eliminate racial disparities and divisions, and address issues that are deeply important to the Vancouver community,” Councilor Perez said.

“Our member councils play an integral role in NLC’s work, bringing local leaders together to share ideas and inform NLC policy about the issues and challenges facing every kind of community in America,” said NLC President David Sander. “I’m excited to have Councilmember Stober serve as Co-Chair for NLC’s REAL Council. The council will ensure that all of our cities, towns and villages have access to ideas and resources they can use to thrive.” 

The leadership of this year’s council will consist of Chair Ty Stober, Councilmember, Vancouver, Washington; Chair Christopher Jones, Councilmember, Harrisonburg, Virginia; Vice Chair Karlene Maxwell Williams, Commissioner, Lauderdale Lakes, Florida; and Vice Chair DeDreana Freeman, Councilmember, Durham, North Carolina.
