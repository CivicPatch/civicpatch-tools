She is the immediate past president of the  [National League of Cities (NLC)](https://www.nlc.org/) , which collectively represents 200 million people across the Country, and connects local leaders with the tools and information to improve the quality of life in their communities. Under her leadership she launched partnerships with the American Planning Association and the Federal Department of Labor that address affordable housing and workforce needs to ensure our residents and our local businesses can fulfil their destiny in Tacoma and across the Country. As a part of these efforts, Tacoma was names one of 16  [Good Jobs, Great Cities](https://www.nlc.org/initiative/good-jobs-great-cities/)  leaders to expand green jobs in Tacoma and Pierce County. Additionally, building on the relationships she has built with Tacomaâ€™s local Puyallup Tribe of Indians, she also launched NLCâ€™s Local Indigenous Leaders Constituency group focuses on native issues across the country.

Locally, her leadership roles include positions on the Puget Sound Regional Council Executive Board, Tacoma-Pierce County Economic Development Board, Greater Seattle Partners, South Sound Housing Affordability Partners, Tideflats Subarea Planning Steering Committee, and the WorkForce Central Board.

Mayor Woodards was also appointed to the  [JustServe National Advisory Council](https://www.justserve.org/about) , the board of  [Power Forward Communities](https://powerforwardcommunities.org/)  and the Advisory Council for  [Accelerator for America](https://www.acceleratorforamerica.org/who-we-are)  where she continues her advocacy on volunteerism and workforce development.

### Before Becoming Mayor

Demonstrating a lifelong track record of public service, Mayor Woodards served for seven years as an at-large member of the City Council before becoming Mayor in 2018. During that time, she launched the Equity and Empowerment initiative which led to the establishment of the Cityâ€™s Office of Equity and Human Rights. She also brought partner organizations together for then President Barack Obamaâ€™s My Brotherâ€™s Keeper initiative and spearheaded the Cityâ€™s Project PEACE initiative which bridged community members with the Tacoma Police Department.
