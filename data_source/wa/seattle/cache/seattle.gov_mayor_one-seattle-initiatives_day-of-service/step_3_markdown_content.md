# One Seattle Day of Service

 The One Seattle Day of Service is a citywide day of volunteerism to give back and take action to improve the city we love.  ![Mayor Harrell and volunteers wearing One Seattle shirt posing for photo in MLK Memorial Park ](images/35bc31cb954257ef0cde74df5c37760a334ceeb4a7b04d60a3734b6d058dbeda.jpg)  

## Volunteer Opportunities

The * __One Seattle Day of Service__* turns the values behind Mayor Harrell’s vision for One Seattle – inclusion, collaboration, cooperation, and service – into shared action and improvement for our City.

On __Saturday, July 12th, 2025__ we will again invite thousands of Seattleites to spend one day serving one another, just under one year out from the FIFA World Cup!

The event is an invitation to every neighbor to roll up their sleeves, come together, and give back with volunteer opportunities in each neighborhood across the city.

Joining together with a diverse group of of public, private, and non-profit partners and organizations, the City will offer a wide array of service opportunities including cleaning and beautification, gardening and restoration, helping neighbors in need, and more.

Stay tuned for more information for 2025.
