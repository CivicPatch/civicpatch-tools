# Mayor Jim Ferrell

 Welcome, 

                 It is a pleasure to welcome you to my official webpage and to the City of Federal Way’s online home.  I hope you will enjoy this page and find it easy to use and informative. 

                Strategically located on Interstate 5 between Seattle and Tacoma in King County, Federal Way is home to 102,000 residents and a Puget Sound population of more than 3 million.  Federal Way is known for its majestic views, quality parks and public facilities, and business-friendly environment.  Incorporated in 1990, Federal Way operates a Mayor-Council form of government and is recognized for the provision of quality public services, excellent streets and city infrastructure, desirable neighborhoods, and quality public safety services. 

                 Federal Way is a community Centered on Opportunity.  We have built a brand new Performing Arts & Event Center, which is a regional draw, showcases national acts, and hosts conferences and events throughout the year.  We have built a unique Low-impact development in our urban core, called  Town Square Park.  The park features a spray park, permeable concrete walking trail, great lawn, a playground for kids, and more than 130 beautiful trees.  Town Square Park serves as the beating heart of our community and is truly a park for all of our residents to enjoy.  

                With the arrival of light rail in 2026, as well as our continued investment in our downtown, you will see Federal Way transform before your very eyes.

  Federal Way is a wonderfully diverse community, rich in spirit, with a strong civic consciousness.  We have numerous community groups including a Historical Society,  active Chamber of Commerce, and great service clubs like the Kiwanis, Rotary, Lions, the American Legion, and VFW, just to name a few. 

                I am proud of the progress we have made in the last decade and I truly believe the best is yet to come.  Please visit this website often and be sure to check out the many ways we continue to move Federal Way forward.   

 Thanks for stopping by!
