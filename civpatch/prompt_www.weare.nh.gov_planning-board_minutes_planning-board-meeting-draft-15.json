Assign confidence (0-1 scale) + brief reason for each field's data.\n- Name: Extract full names ONLY (e.g., \"Denyse McGriff\", not \"Mayor Denyse McGriff\"). Titles go in 'positions'.\n- Positions:\n  - Extract ONLY active roles matching Target Roles/Examples (municipal legislative/executive).\n  - **Focus on Main Governing Body**: Prioritize extracting members of the primary municipal governing body\n    (e.g., Town Council, City Council, Select Board). The `Key roles` and `Examples` provided to you primarily refer to positions on this main body.\n  - **Secondary Boards (e.g., Planning Board, Zoning Board, Commissions):**\n    - If the content is clearly about a specific secondary board (e.g., a page titled \"Planning Board Members\" or \"Zoning Commission Roster\"):\n      - **Do NOT extract individuals solely based on leadership roles held *within that specific secondary board*\n        (such as 'Chair of the Planning Board', 'Planning Board Vice-Chair', 'Zoning Secretary').\n        ** These titles by themselves do not make them members of the primary governing body.**\n      - ONLY extract an individual from such a page if their listed role *also explicitly and unambiguously* indicates they are concurrently a member of,\n        or a designated representative/liaison FROM or TO, the primary governing body\n        (e.g., \"Town Council Representative to the Planning Board\", \"Selectman Liaison to Conservation\", \"Council Member (also on Zoning Board)\").\n      - *Example*: If a page lists \"Jane Doe, Chair\" under \"Planning Board Members\", and no other role links Jane Doe to the Town Council, Jane Doe\n        should NOT be extracted as a member of the primary governing body. However, if the page lists \"John Smith, Town Council Rep.\",\n        John Smith SHOULD be extracted with his primary role as \"Town Council Member\" (if that is a key role) and optionally \"Town Council Rep.\" if that detail is desired.\n    - If a person *is* identified as a representative from the primary governing body *to* a secondary board (as in the John Smith example above),\n      ensure you extract their role on the primary governing body (e.g., \"Council Member\" if that is a Key Role from your list of target roles).\n  - **Handling Resignations/Vacancies**: If the text explicitly states that a person has **resigned, vacated their position, is deceased, or their position\n    is otherwise noted as vacant (e.g., \"applications being accepted for this seat\")**, DO NOT include them as a current office holder or extract their position.\n    The statement of resignation or vacancy takes precedence over any listed future term dates when determining current active status.\n    For example, if a person was \"Elected Nov 2024 for term ending Dec 2028\" but then \"Resigned April 15\", they should NOT be included in the output as an active member.\n  - **Include specific division, district, or position identifier if present.**\n    - If the source uses numeric identifiers like \"#1\", \"No. 2\", or similar for a role (e.g., in a table column named \"Position\" or \"District\"),\n      interpret this as a position number.\n    - **Prefer the term \"Position X\" (e.g., \"Position 1\", \"Position 2\") when a numeric identifier is used, unless the source text clearly and consistently\n      uses a different term like \"Seat X\" or \"Ward X\" for those numbered roles on the same page.**\n    - Combine with the main role, e.g., \"Council Member, Position 1\".\n  - EXCLUDE judicial, most admin staff, non-municipal.\n  - For position extraction:\n    - **Core Membership Role Inclusion**:\n      - The `Key roles` list provided to you contains canonical names for primary/core membership roles on the main governing body\n        (e.g., \"Council Member\", \"Select Board Member\", \"Commissioner\", \"Alderman\", \"Trustee\").\n      - For each person, if their roles extracted directly from the text include:\n          a) A *leadership position* from the `Key roles` list that applies to the main governing body\n            (e.g., \"Mayor\" if they preside over the Council, \"Chair\", \"President\"), OR\n          b) Any other role from the `Key roles` or `Examples` that clearly signifies membership on that main governing body\n            (even if it's a more specific version, a common variation,\n            or an alias of a core membership role – e.g., text says \"Selectman\" and \"Select Board Member\" is a Key Role;\n            text says \"Councilmember At-Large\" and \"Council Member\" is a Key Role),\n      - THEN you MUST ensure that the relevant canonical primary/core membership role from `Key roles`\n        (e.g., \"Select Board Member\", \"Council Member\") is included in their `positions` array.\n      - *Example*: If \"Council Member\" is a key core role, a person listed as \"Council President\" should have both \"Council President\" AND \"Council Member\"\n         in their positions. If \"Select Board Member\" is a key core role, a person listed only as \"Selectman\" (a common variation/alias)\n         should also have \"Select Board Member\" listed.\n    - **Additional Specific Roles**:\n      - In addition to the ensured core membership role, also include all other distinct,\n        active municipal roles or more specific titles found in the text, provided they match the `Key Roles` or `Examples` OR \n        if they represent a clear representative role from the primary governing body to another board/commission.\n          This includes specific committee assignments, liaison roles, or detailed versions of their main role\n          if they add clarity beyond the core membership role (e.g., \"Council Member, Ward 3\", \"Select Board Representative to Finance Committee\").\n    - **Clarity and Conciseness**:\n      - When multiple terms in the text describe the exact same specific responsibility (e.g., \"Board of Selectmen's Representative to Planning Board\" \n        and \"Selectmen's Rep to Planning Board\"), prefer the most complete, official-sounding, or consistently used term from the source for that \n        specific responsibility. Avoid redundant listings *for the exact same specific role* if one is merely an abbreviation of the other. \n        However, this does not override the rule to include both the core membership role and a more specific title if they represent different levels of detail \n        (e.g., \"Council Member\" and \"Council Member, District A\").\n- Image: Extract URL of portrait/headshot near name. Ignore logos, banners, icons. Check alt text but prioritize proximity/style.\n- Contact Details (Phone/Email/Website):\n  - Associate details logically if near the person's name/section.\n  - Phone Prefixes: Extract number after labels like \"Office:\", \"Cell:\", \"Mobile:\", \"Direct:\", \"Home:\". Exclude \"Fax:\". Format numbers simply.\n  - Markdown Links: Extract email/phone from the VISIBLE TEXT of links like `[TEXT](...)`, ignore the target URL.\n  - `website` data MUST be a valid http/https URL. Prefer profile pages. EXCLUDE mailto:, tel:.\n  - `email` data should ONLY contain email addresses.\n- Term Dates (`start_date`, `end_date`):\n  - Extract start_date and end_date in YYYY, YYYY-MM, or YYYY-MM-DD format.\n  - Acceptable date phrases include:\n    - “Elected [date]”, “Appointed [date]”, “Term: [date1] to [date2]”, “Since [date]”.\n    - Convert natural language to proper format (e.g., \"January 2025\" → 2025-01)\n    - Ignore vague phrases like \"Spring 2025\".\n\n**FINAL MANDATORY CHECK**: Review your entire response for accuracy before submitting, paying close attention to the date extraction,\nconversion, and term identification rules.\n"},{"role":"user","content":"The page URL is: https://www.weare.nh.gov/planning-board/minutes/planning-board-meeting-draft-15\nHere is the content (in markdown):\n\n\n"}]
