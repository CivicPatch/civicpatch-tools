# Traffic Safety Committee

### SECTION XV Rules & Policies of City Council

Current Council standing committees are the Committee on Traffic Safety and Transportation, Committee on Accounts and Claims, Committee on Elections and Committee on Emergency Action. Such committees will operate under the rules and requirements for public bodies. The Committee on Traffic Safety and Transportation will be constituted and operate as follows:

 __Makeup:__ 

The Committee on Traffic Safety and Transportation shall be made up of four members of the Council. These shall be appointed by the Mayor and Council at each post-election organizational meeting. The members of the Committee shall elect a member to serve as Chair.

 __Purpose:__ 

The Committee on Traffic Safety & Transportation performs the role of reviewing and making recommendations on traffic safety issues before the City Council finally acts upon them. It also acts as the City’s Highway Safety Committee with respect to Highway Safety Grants.

 __Staff Support:__ 

The Police Department and, to a lesser extent, the Public Works Department or other Departments when needed, provide staff expertise with respect to traffic safety issues. The Police Department, utilizing Public Works as necessary, should provide advance information, record and publish summary minutes and follow through with publishing the actual recommendations of the Committee on Traffic Safety & Transportation. The Police Department and the Public Works Department, as needed, should regularly attend Committee on Traffic Safety & Transportation, providing it, in advance as much as possible, with the information it needs and with recommendations as appropriate so that the Committee on Traffic Safety & Transportation is in a position to make informed traffic safety policy recommendations to the Council which are as consistent as possible and able to be reasonably enforced.

 __Protocol:__ 

Traffic safety issues which are formally submitted to the Council by the public via signed letters or e-mails addressed to the Mayor and Council or Committee on Traffic Safety & Transportation will be placed on the next available regular City Council or Council Work Session agenda. The petitioner of an issue actually referred to the Committee on Traffic Safety & Transportation will be invited to attend the meeting of the Committee on Traffic Safety & Transportation at which their item is considered.

Traffic safety issues which are raised by the City staff (Police Department, Public Works Dept. etc) or by the Committee on Traffic Safety & Transportation members, may be brought directly to any regular meeting of the Committee on Traffic Safety & Transportation by having it placed in advance on such Committee on Traffic Safety & Transportation regular meeting agenda with the advance approval of the Chair of the Committee on Traffic Safety & Transportation. The Mayor and Council will be apprised of all such issues brought directly before the Committee on Traffic Safety & Transportation.
