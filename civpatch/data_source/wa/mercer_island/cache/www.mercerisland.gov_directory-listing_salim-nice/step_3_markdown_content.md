# Mayor Salim Nice

  ![Salim Nice](https://www.mercerisland.gov/sites/default/files/styles/full_node_primary/public/imageattachments/citycouncil/page/13121/nice_2018.jpg?itok=RJqV7N2Y)  

### Position No. 2, Term: 1/1/2022 - 12/31/2025

 

### Phone: 206-275-7997

### Email: [salim.nice@mercerisland.gov](mailto:salim.nice@mercerisland.gov) 

 

 Salim Nice is a dedicated public servant and accomplished professional with a strong background in government reimbursement, tax, and technology. He currently serves as the President and Chief Executive Officer of Healthcare Reimbursement Solutions (HRS), bringing over 20 years of experience in leading teams and executing strategic plans. 

 Before assuming his role as Mayor of Mercer Island, Salim built an impressive career in operations and technology, spearheading solutions that revolutionized how hospitals leverage government data. Under his leadership, he successfully managed the recovery of more than $1B for US Hospital providers, setting new standards for identifying reimbursement opportunities. 

 Salim co-founded Healthcare Payment Specialists LLC, where he served as Senior Vice President, Chief Operating Officer, and Chief Technology Officer. Under his guidance, the company grew from a team of three to more than 100 employees before being acquired by TransUnion in 2018 and soon after by FinThrive. 

 Salim's commitment to public service is evident in his involvement with the Mercer Island City Council. He was elected to Position 2 in November 2017 and served by appointment in Position 4 from July 2017 to November 2017. Salim's leadership qualities were recognized by the City Council when he was elected as Deputy Mayor for 2018-2019 and subsequently as Mayor in 2022. Salim was re-elected Mayor for 2024-2025. 

 Beyond his civic duties, Salim volunteers with the Islands Oil Spill Association (IOSA), a non-profit, community-based, community-supported oil spill response organization that serves the San Juan Islands. 

 A Mercer Island native, Salim holds a degree from Seattle University, and he is happily married to Janice Nice, also a Mercer Island native. Together, they are proud parents of a young child. 

 Salim's expertise, leadership, and dedication make him a valuable asset to the City of Mercer Island. As Mayor, he continues prioritizing the community's welfare and striving for excellence in every aspect of his responsibilities.
