##  __Contact the City Council__ 

Councilmembers listen to their constituents, the Island residents, and also receive advice and help from the Council-appointed Boards and Commissions. The Council is vitally interested in hearing the voices of all the residents and in increasing citizen involvement. All Councilmembers serve at large for a standard term of four years; appointees filling vacated seats generally serve a shorter term. Every other January, the Council itself selects a Mayor and Deputy Mayor from among the seven councilmembers for a two-year period.
