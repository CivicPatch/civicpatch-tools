Public Comments

There are many Council meetings which provide the opportunity for “Public Comments”. This is a time for you to share something with the entire Council that you believe has a greater community impact. It’s also a great way to comment on items on the published agenda, or to participate in more formal “Public Hearings”. [Check out the calendar](https://www.kenmorewa.gov/our-city/calendar) for upcoming Council meetings, and look for a “Public Comments” segment.

To provide virtual public comment during a Council meeting, please fill out the [Virtual Public Comment Form](https://www.kenmorewa.gov/government/city-council/virtual-public-comment) before 12:00 Noon of the day of the meeting.
