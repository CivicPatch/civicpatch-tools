# Councilmember Ruth Pérez

#### Strong communication is key to success for Renton

Ruth Pérez was appointed in 2014 to the Renton City Council, becoming the first Latina and immigrant to ever serve in this body. In 2015, she was elected to complete the term and re-elected in 2017 and 2021. Councilmember Pérez holds a BA in Communications and a Master’s in Business Administration. 

In 2019, she was unanimously elected by her colleagues to serve as Renton Council President and in 2024 as Council President Pro Tem. During her tenure, she has chaired and served on every council committee. Furthermore, in 2021, she proved her leadership by being elected to be the first female to serve as Chair of the Renton Regional Fire Authority Governance Board.  

Councilmember Ruth Pérez has an extensive background in public service and a very successful professional career.  She began her career as a television reporter and later was the editor-in-chief and founder of three magazines. She also worked with former Governor Gary Locke and at the Consulate of Mexico in Seattle.

As a councilmember, Ruth focuses on the issues that truly impact Renton residents’ everyday lives and has worked to ensure a strong economy, expand access to affordable housing, tackle our city’s transportation and traffic issues, build inclusive policies, encourage innovation, and balance the municipal budget.

Ruth was voted “Renton’s Best Elected Official” in 2018 &amp; 2019, received an Advanced Certificate of Municipal Leadership from the Association of Washington Cities in 2019, and honored as a “Woman of the Year” in 2016.

Councilmember Pérez stays busy educating herself and serving Renton.  During her tenure on the City Council, she has represented the people of Renton on many regional boards and committees.

Ruth and her husband, Al, live in the Snake Hill Neighborhood of Renton with their two dogs: Frida and Pablito. She is excited to give back to the community that has given so much to her.
