# Councilmember Valerie O'Halloran

![Headshot of Councilmember O'Halloran](https://www.rentonwa.gov/files/assets/city/v/2/elected/city-council/images/valerie-ohalloran_900x900.jpg?dimension=pageimage&w=480)

Valerie was unanimously elected to serve as the 2023 Council President. She recently served on the Renton Regional Fire Authority Governance Board as Chair, Sound Cities Association Public Issues Committee, King County Flood District Advisory Committee, the I-405/I-167 Executive Advisory Group, and WRIA 8 Salmon Recovery Council.

Valerie has been a resident of Renton since 1996. She and her husband, Michael, live in the Heather Downs neighborhood of the Renton Highlands.

Over the course of her 30-year business career, Valerie held positions of increasing responsibility in the fields of accounting, financial analysis, systems and process improvement. Prior to her recent retirement, Valerie was a Senior Finance Systems Analyst for a major medical device manufacturer in the region.

Valerie is driven by a desire to serve our community. She is known as a collaborative problem-solver who brings people together to get things done, ensuring that those most impacted by decisions have a voice at the table. She looks to continuing to represent all citizens and working toward a shared vision for Renton.

In her free time, Valerie enjoys cooking, reading, beach-walking and crossword puzzles.
