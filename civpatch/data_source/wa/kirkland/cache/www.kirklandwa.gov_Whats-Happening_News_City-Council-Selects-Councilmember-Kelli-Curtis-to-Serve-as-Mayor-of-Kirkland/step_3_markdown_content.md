Kirkland, Wash – During its January 2, 2024, Council meeting, the Kirkland City Council selected Councilmember Kelli Curtis to serve as mayor and Councilmember Jay Arnold to serve as deputy mayor.

Mayor Curtis was appointed to the Council in February 2019 and elected to her first term in November 2019. She was re-elected to her second term in 2023.  Mayor Curtis has lived in Kirkland for almost 30 years. 

“I'm truly honored to be selected by my fellow colleagues to lead this city as Mayor,” said Mayor Kelli Curtis. “I’m excited about the future of Kirkland and the opportunity to continue the incredible progress we’ve made on our Council Goals and City Work Plans. I look forward to serving this dedicated, hardworking council and this wonderful city to the best of my ability.”

In addition to serving as Chair of the City’s Legislative Work Group and the Parks Funding Exploratory Committee, Mayor Curtis also serves as SCA Caucus Chair on the Growth Management Planning Council, as an alternate on the King County Regional Water Quality Committee, and as an alternate on the Puget Sound Regional Council Growth Management Policy Board. 

The City of Kirkland operates under the “council-manager” form of government, which means that the mayor’s responsibilities are primarily to preside at council meetings and act as head of the City for ceremonial purposes and for purposes of military law. The mayor votes as a councilmember and does not have any veto power. 

More information on Mayor Curtis and the City Council can be found on the City’s website: [https://www.kirklandwa.gov/Government/City-Council](https://www.kirklandwa.gov/Government/City-Council)
