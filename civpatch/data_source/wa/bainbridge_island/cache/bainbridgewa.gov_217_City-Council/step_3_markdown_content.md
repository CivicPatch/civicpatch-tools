## **Government Structure**

The City of Bainbridge Island is a non-charter code city with a council / manager form of government. The City Council members are elected officers, each of whom have been a registered voter and resident of the city for a period of at least one year preceding their election.

The responsibilities and authority of the city manager and the City Council are regulated by the [Revised Code of Washington (RCW) Section 35A.13](https://app.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=35a.13).

The City Council is the legislative branch of city government. The City Council can set public policy in two major ways:

1. By enacting ordinances during the year
2. By establishing budgetary (taxing and spending) policies

Council duties also include defining the functions, powers and duties of city officers and employees.

## Council - Manager

Under the council - manager form of government, the members of the City Council choose a chair from among their number on a biennial basis. The chair has the title of mayor and presides at Council meetings. He or she also continues to have all the rights, privileges, and immunities of a member of the Council. The mayor is recognized as the head of the city for ceremonial purposes.

He or she has no regular administrative duties, but in time of public danger or emergency, if so authorized by ordinance, shall take command of the police, maintain law, and enforce order. The City Council also selects a mayor pro tem, to serve in the absence or temporary disability of the mayor. The mayor pro tem also presides over City Council study sessions.

## Manual of City Governance Policies, Procedures and Guidelines

The [Manual of City Governance Policies, Procedures and Guidelines](https://bainbridgewa.gov/DocumentCenter/View/16487/Governance-Manual) is a legislative document which serves as both a guide and directive for the conduct of legislative/executive operations on behalf of the Island’s citizens. To understand this effort more completely:

- Browse the directory which can link you to specific subjects and then link you to outside sources of relevant law or best practices.
- Read the active menu of public participation attachments and open government protocols which demonstrate the city’s determination to merit your trust.
- Read the purpose, scope, and guiding principles of this important document.

## Guide to Council Meetings

Council meetings occur on Tuesday nights at 6 p.m. and the Council does not generally meet on a fifth Tuesday of the month. This [Guide to Council Meetings](https://bainbridgewa.gov/DocumentCenter/View/14859/A-Guide-to-City-Council-Meetings) is a general overview of the City Council meeting process and is intended to help you better understand your local government. Learn about the City Council meeting process, including the types of Council actions, agenda items, and more.
