##  Jonathan Bingle 

 *City Council Member, District 1* 

Term: 2022-2025

 [jbingle@spokanecity.org](mailto:jbingle@spokanecity.org) 

A lifelong resident of Northeast Spokane, Council Member Bingle is uniquely suited to understand the historic challenges and current needs of District 1. He graduated from Rogers High School and studied at Spokane Falls Community College before launching his first small business 11 years ago. As a small business owner, Jonathan has fostered deep relationships within the community and developed a robust understanding of the challenges small businesses in Spokane face on a daily basis. As such, Jonathan will always support local businesses and promote positive growth in Northeast Spokane, especially as the community recovers from COVID. Our small businesses are the lifeblood of our local economy, and their success is imperative for our community to thrive.

Jonathan's family has a long history of International Ministry, bringing food, water, medicine, and the Gospel to rural villages in need. His charitable endeavors and community service have made him deeply devoted to doing what he can to help others build a stronger family and community. Jonathan is committed to making Spokane the best place to live, work, and raise a family, just as he is doing with his wife Christina and their young son, Samuel.

Jonathan is also committed to bringing common sense back to City Council. His priorities are to strength the resources devoted to Northeast Spokane and protect its economic future as we continue to grow as a city. He will give our law enforcement officers the support and funding they need to keep our neighborhoods safe, while also working to find sensible solutions to the housing and homelessness crisis in Spokane.
