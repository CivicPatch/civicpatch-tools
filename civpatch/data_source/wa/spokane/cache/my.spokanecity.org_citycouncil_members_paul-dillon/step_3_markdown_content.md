 *City Council Member, District 2* 

Term: 2024-2027

509.564.4569

 [pdillon@spokanecity.org](mailto:pdillon@spokanecity.org) 

Paul has proudly lived in District 2 for more than two decades. He and his wife, Tiffany, recently welcomed their daughter, Hazel, into the world. They live in the East Central neighborhood and can often be seen walking their dogs, Walter and Fern, down Perry Street. Paul deeply loves Spokane, starting his first job with the City in the Spokane Parks Department in 2006. He co-founded and launched Down To Earth in 2007, an environmental advocacy and sustainability news site that the Spokesman-Review published.

As past Vice President of Public Affairs for Planned Parenthood Greater Washington and North Idaho, Paul led and managed grassroots efforts to organize, empower, and mobilize communities to take action for exceptional healthcare services, honest education, and fearless advocacy.

In 2009, Paul began working with former District 2 Council Member Jon Snyder. Paul was instrumental in developing the Complete Streets ordinance which made sure the city built, operated, and maintained streets that enabled safe access for all, including pedestrians, bicyclists, motorists and transit riders of all ages and abilities. In 2011, Paul headed to Olympia to work with then Representative Andy Billig. Together, they championed voter access, protecting the Spokane River, and creating a balanced budget to support working families before Representative Billig headed to the Senate.

After working with the YMCA as the Youth and Government program director, Paul moved on to Planned Parenthood of Greater Washington and North Idaho in 2015, where he served until elected as Spokane City Council Member for District 2.

In addition to his professional experience, Paul has a long community engagement and volunteering history. Paul remains a board member with Washington Bus. He has also previously served as a board member for the Center for Justice, Greater Spokane Progress, Washington Bikes, Pedals2People and volunteered with KYRS Thin Air Community, Terrain Spokane, Spokane Community Against Racism, Spokane River Clean Up, and Pro-Choice Washington.
