 *City Council Member, District 2* 

Term: 2024-2025

 [lnavarrete@spokanecity.org](mailto:lnavarrete@spokanecity.org) 

Lili Navarrete and her family immigrated to Spokane from Mexico City in 1988. She has been living in District 2 for 34 years. Lili briefly attended Frances Scott Elementary, formerly known as Sheridan, but was later transferred to Stevens Elementary to participate in the English as a Second Language (ESL) program. After graduating from Ferris High School, she obtained a BA in International Affairs from Eastern Washington University, with minors in Economics and Business Administration.

Advocacy is central to her career. Lili was the Director of Public Affairs and Raíz at Planned Parenthood of Greater Washington and North Idaho for eight years, where she fought for reproductive rights, immigrants, and marginalized communities. Lili was the Vice President of the Hispanic Business/Professional Association and was appointed by Governor Inslee as a Commissioner on Hispanic Affairs in 2020.

Lili has been an active member of the Spokane Immigrant Rights Coalition and the Washington Immigration Solidarity Network. She played an instrumental role in the passing of the Reproductive Health Care Access For All Act and worked tirelessly to combat racial profiling in Spokane. In addition, Lili previously served as a commissioner for the Office of Police Ombuds for District 2.

Aside from representing District 2, she also works as the Community Health Equity Organizer for WSU’s Elson S. Floyd College of Medicine and is the Chair of Health Equity for Nuestras Raices. Lili has owned restaurants in Spokane and Coeur d'Alene and holds a Washington State Cosmetology license.
