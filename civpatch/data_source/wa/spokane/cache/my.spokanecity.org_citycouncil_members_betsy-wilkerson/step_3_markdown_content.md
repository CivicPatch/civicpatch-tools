[bwilkerson@spokanecity.org](mailto:bwilkerson@spokanecity.org)

Council President Betsy Wilkerson is a long-time small business owner and community servant who grew up in Spokane and has strong family roots within District 2. She is proud to be the second African American woman to serve on City Council in Spokane's history and the first female and person of color to serve as Council President. She has raised two children in the city and is also a proud, active grandmother of three high schoolers. Her mother was a minister and co-founded the Mt. Zion Holiness Church. Council President Wilkerson is dedicated to making sure that every resident of the city has the tools to succeed in life and that Spokane remains a City of Promise that attracts people from all over to make it their hometown.

By supporting public services and institutions like community centers, non-profits and local business associations she believes that community is where we find our strength. Through partnering with the neighborhood councils of Spokane, the volunteer city boards and commissions, and the various community associations that keep Spokane the vibrant and economic heart of our Region, she knows that Spokane can build a future where everyone can thrive together.

Being familiar with the volunteer and non-profit sector Council President Wilkerson most recently chaired the board of the Carl Maxey Center and led two capital campaigns to raise funds for the center in the historic East Central Neighborhood, which is named after the civil rights icon from Spokane. She currently runs a family business that houses individuals with disabilities while working with various organizations and non-profit boards, making grants that impact communities with basic needs, educational supports and capital monies.

Council President Wilkerson is wholeheartedly committed to building a community that is inclusive of everyone and wants to help every person in Spokane realize their full potential. If you see her around your neighborhood please feel free to say hello or reach out over email and schedule a coffee meeting, she would love to hear from you and is excited to work with you in writing our city's next chapter.

![Mark Carlos](https://static.spokanecity.org/photos/2021/12/09/mark-carlos/3x4/medium/mark-carlos.jpg)

As Council President Betsy Wilkerson’s Legislative Assistant, Mark Carlos is proud to be the first Man of Color to hold the position on Council and aims to help her bring leadership opportunities to not only Communities of Color but those in the parts of Spokane that have felt left out and underrepresented. He is passionate about regional issues, Equitable Access to Broadband, and engaging working class youth and young adults who often find shift work to be a barrier to participating in the community.

Mark is a long time community organizer, first serving in student government starting in middle school and serving with his church youth group where he eventually became an Assistant Youth Minister. He continued his advocacy work as part of the Associated Student Government at Spokane Falls Community College through his various roles as Club Liaison, Legislative &amp; Finance Director, and the Eastern Washington Regional Representative for the Washington Community &amp; Technical Colleges Student Association (WACTCSA). Among his proudest achievements at SFCC are hosting the first on-campus ballot collection drive, reviving the historic Red Nations Club, and reorganizing the LGBTQ+ Alliance. He also orchestrated The Week of the Woman, A Women's Suffrage Centennial Celebration which featured Congresswoman McMorris Rodgers, and the diverse female leaders that then-served at SFCC in the administration, the faculty and in Student Organizations. Through campus workshops it also highlighted the work yet to be done when it comes to women, access and positions of power.

When he finds time Mark likes to go out with friends, attempt his hand at gardening, try new recipes, volunteer at his church and spend time with his family. Feel free to say hi when you see him out serving in the community, or send him an email so he can connect you with the Council President. They are both more than happy to help the residents of this wonderful city we get to call home!
