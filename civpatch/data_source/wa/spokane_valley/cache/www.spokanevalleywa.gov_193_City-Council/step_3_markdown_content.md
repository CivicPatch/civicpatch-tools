# City Council

![Community Conversations](https://www.spokanevalleywa.gov/ImageRepository/Document?documentID=3416 "Community Conversations")

## Join the Conversation!

Join your City Councilmembers, city staff and neighbors once a month for an open house-style event. There is no formal program, so stop by at any time - come say hi, ask questions and share your thoughts on any number of topics. The next event is **Tuesday, June 17 at 5 p.m. in the City Hall lobby**. See you there!

 

## Members

The seven City Council positions are at-large. Councilmembers are generally elected to four-year terms, with elections held every two years. For continuity, position terms are staggered by two years to ensure all positions are not open for election at the same time.

## Spokane Valley Form of Government

The City of Spokane Valley, incorporated March 31, 2003, is a non-charter code city and operates under a Council-manager plan of government. It is governed under the optional municipal code of [RCW Chapter 35A](https://apps.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?Cite=35A). Under this form of government, legislative authority is concentrated in the elected City Council, which hires a professional administrator to implement its policies. The executive branch is led by the city manager. Read more in the Spokane Valley Governance Manual.

## Council Salaries

As a result of the work of the Spokane Valley Independent Salary Commission, as documented in their final report, the monthly salary of the Mayor is $2,250, and the monthly salary of each Councilmember is $1,800, effective April 19, 2022.

## Election of Mayor &amp; Deputy Mayor

Biennially at the first meeting of the new Council, the members choose a chair from among their fellow Councilmembers. The chair of the Council shall have the title of Mayor and preside at meetings of the Council. The Mayor is a regular member of the City Council and as such, has all the rights, privileges, and immunities of any other member. 

The Mayor is recognized as the head of the City for ceremonial purposes and by the Governor for purposes of military law and has no regular administrative duties. Also, biennially, at the first meeting of a new Council, the members, by majority vote, may designate a fellow Councilmember as Deputy Mayor to serve in the absence or temporary disability of the Mayor.

## Regional Representation

Spokane Valley Councilmembers and community members are involved in a number of area commissions, committees and boards to remain active in issues facing our region. In some cases, city volunteers also serve. If you are interested in volunteer service, please view the [commissions, committees and boards](https://www.spokanevalleywa.gov/198/Commissions-Committees-Boards) webpage.
