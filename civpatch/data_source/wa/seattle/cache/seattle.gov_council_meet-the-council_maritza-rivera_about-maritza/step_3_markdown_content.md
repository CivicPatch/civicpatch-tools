Maritza Rivera grew up in New York City, and attended Bronx High School of Science, followed by Skidmore College on a full-ride scholarship, then Fordham Law School, before accepting a position in the White House as President Clinton’s Hispanic liaison. She later served as a Vice-President of the National Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, where she worked closely with Hispanic small businesses from across the country.

In Seattle, Maritza has had the privilege of working at the ACLU post 9/11 to protect Muslim communities from xenophobia, at City Hall working for Former City Council Member Tom Rasmussen, for Mayor Jenny Durkan, and most recently in Mayor BruceHarrell’s Administration as Deputy Director of the Department of Arts & Culture.

Maritza loves Seattle, the small businesses, food, arts, music, and diverse populations that make up our city’s rich fabric.
