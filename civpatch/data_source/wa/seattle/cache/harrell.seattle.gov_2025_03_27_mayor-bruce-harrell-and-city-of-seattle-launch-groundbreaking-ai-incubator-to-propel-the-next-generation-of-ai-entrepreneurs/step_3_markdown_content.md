Through a $210,000 investment from OED to support programmatic needs, and $400,000 from Washington Department of Commerce for real estate, the city partnered with the AI2 Incubator and Ada Developer’s Academy to move the AI House from concept to reality. This space will not only foster technological advancement but will also integrate with local businesses to spur real-world applications and solutions. Examples of current founders a part of the AI House ecosystem include founders developing new technologies to reduce retail theft in corner stores, streamline mortgage underwriting to make homeownership more accessible, and improve real-time healthcare monitoring to save lives and reduce ICU nurse burnout. AI House is shaping a future where Seattle leads the world in AI advancements and economic growth.  

“We are positioning Seattle as the leader in AI innovation. This technology has the power to dramatically change our world, and we want Seattle to be at the forefront of shaping it to help solve some of our most complex and vexing challenges,”  __said Markham McIntyre, Director of Seattle’s Office of Economic Development. __ “AI House will be Seattle’s nexus of our innovative ideas, talented people, and business acumen. It’s an incredible partnership effort to expand access to economic opportunities in the AI field.”

Through the AI House partnership, as AI projects mature, they can expand into long-term spaces in Downtown Seattle, fueling economic growth and growing the roster of AI companies in Seattle.
